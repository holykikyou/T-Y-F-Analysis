All of a sudden we can see the whole sphere a great gigantic blue ball covered with a white lace of clouds
It was spectacular
We see the curve of the earth and you see that the atmosphere is so tiny and thin compared to this planet
You understand that wow there's not that much there that's protecting us from the vacuum of space
Here we are going 17000 miles per hour going over this incredibly beautiful planet and here is this thin blue iridescent band
Everything that enables life to exist on this amazing ball of rock flying through space
Our planet is changing
Since the late 19th century the earth has already warmed at least 1 degree Celsius
And we are seeing the devastating impacts
More severe weather
Catastrophic events
And challenges to our lives and livelihoods
How much warmer our planet gets and how severe the impacts will be is up to us
The next decade is critical
We must change the course we're on in order to limit the rise in global temperature to 15 degrees Celsius
If we succeed we will protect the most vulnerable preserve eco Msystems and wildlife redu our exposure so heat and storms create a healthier and more equitable world and create new economic opportunities for all
The challenges are clear
But so are the solutions
The question is how do we move fast enough to keep the world on track to limit the rise in global temperatures
In my view we already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis
We can't wait longer
How do we make bigger bolder changes than ever before
Governments must deliver the transformational change that the world needs and that people demand with much stronger ambition
How do we create new economic opportunities and ensure a just transition
Certainly we face an unprecedented crisis
But also an unprecedented opportunity to build back better a healthier more productive more resilient society
We must step up to this challenge
How do we create a more sustainable future for people and the planet
I'm that together with compassion and commitment we can all transform
We know we must
We know the time to act is now
We must go faster and further than ever before
To bring countries of the world together to raise ambition and meet this moment
That's the only way for the world to succeed together
This is how we solve the climate crisis
Together
Please welcome the President and the Vice President of the United States
Your excellencies distinguished leaders and esteemed colleagues from around the world welcome to this historic leaders summit on climate
I want to thank you for being here and for your leadership
I have spoken with a number of you about the climate crisis
We have talked about the scarcity of water
We have talked about the need to build a resilience
And we have talked about the importance of investing in clean technologies
Together of course we come from very different places but we share this common concern
And this common threat
Here in the United States the storms hitting our Gulf coast are worse every year
The wildfires in my homestate of California have grown in intensity
And of course no nation or region is immune
Whether it is western Europe where heat waves made it very difficult to stay indoors while risking a health risk or the Pacific islands where rising sea levels threaten to encroach on the land and homes of life-long residents
Or in central America where last year two major hurricanes devastated entire communities
As a global community it is imperative that we act quickly and together to confront this crisis
And this will require innovation and collaboration around the world
It will require the use of renewable energy and new technologies and it will give each of our nations the opportunity to build healthier communities and stronger economies
Here we believe tackling climate change improving communities and creating jobs can occur simultaneously
And we must recognize the importance of course of justice in the work that we do
The communities hardest hit by climate change are the same communities harmed by wealth and gender inequality
Toxic air pollution and so much more
This truth holds around the world
So I urge all of us to focus on these communities including indigenous communities and consider their insight and experience in our efforts moving forward
They are critical leaders in this fight
Friends the health of our communities the wellbeing of our workers and the strength of our economies depend on what we do now
And I can think of no one more committed to achieving that collective goal than president Joe Biden
The president was one of the first members in the United States Congress to take on the issue of climate change
And on our first day in office he led the fact that we would rejoin the Paris agreement
And the president is just getting started as we work to tackle the climate crisis by creating clean energy jobs across our nation
It is now my great honor to introduce the President of the United States Joe Biden
Thank you madam vice president
Good morning to the leaders around the world for taking part in the sum miss
I thank you
Your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nations and to the people of every nation especially our young people that we are ready to meet this moment
And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet
It's also about providing a better future for all of us
That's why when people talk about climate I think jobs
Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation ready to be fired up
That's why I've proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents on behalf of our workers and our communities especially those too often left out or left behind
We want to lead the critical industries that produce and deploy clean technologies both those we can harness today and those that we will invent I talk to the experts and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future
The signs are unmistakable
The science is undeniable
The costs of inaction keep mounting
The United States isn't waiting we are resolved to take action
Not only the federal government but cities and states across the country small businesses and large corporations and American workers in every field
I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying middle class union jobs
I see laborers and line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean modern resilient grid
I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up and abandoned coal mines that need to be reclaimed putting a stop to methane leaks and protecting the health of our communities
I see autoworkers building the next generation of electric vehicles and electricians installing 500000 charging Stations along our highways
I see the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement and produce clean power
I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make the soil of our heartland the next frontier of carbon innovation
By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work the United States sets out on the road to cut our greenhouse gases in half and half by the end of this decade
That's where we are headed as a nation
That's what we can do if we take action to build an economy that is not only more prosperous but healthier fairer and cleaner For the entire planet
These steps will set America on a path to a net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050
But the truth is America represents less than 15 of the world's emissions
No nation can solve this crisis On our own as I know you fully understand
All of us and particularly those of us representing the world's largest economies have to step up
Those that do take action and make bold investments in their people and in a clean energy future will win the good jobs of tomorrow and make their economies more resilient and more competitive
Let's run that race to win a More sustainable future than we have now and overcome the existential crisis of our times
We know just how critically important that is
Because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade
This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of a climate crisis
We must try to keep the earth's temperature to an increase of 15 degrees Celsius tmore mean more frequent fires heat waves tearing through communities and ripping lives and livelihoods
Dire impacts to our public health
An undeniable accelerating and Punishing reality will come if we don't move
We can't resign ourselves to that future
We have to take action all of us
And this summit is our first step on the road we'll travel together to and through Glasgow this November at the UN Climate Change Conference
To set our world on a path to a secure prosperous and sustainable future
The health of our communities depends on it
The wellbeing of our workers depends on it
The strength of our economies depends on it
The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that's coming
We're here at this summit to discuss how each of us each country can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create good-paying jobs advance innovative technologies and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts
We have to move
We have to move quickly to meet these challenges
We must get on the path now in order to do that
If we do we'll breathe easier literally and figuratively
We'll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future
And that can be your goal as well
This is a moral imperative
An economic imperative
A moment of peril but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities
Time is short but I believe we can do this
I believe that we will do this
Thank you for being part of this summit
Thank you for the commitments you have made and the communities you're from
God bless you all
I look forward to progress we can make today and beyond
We really have no choice
We have to get this done
Good morning
Good afternoon good evening
We are so grateful to have all of you with us today
As President Biden and Vice President Harris made clear we intend to do more to meet this crisis
What we do at home can keep the earth's warming to 15 degrees Celsius
That's why we're raising our ambitions and we'll meet the new targets we set
Of course no country can overcome this threat alone
We're in this together
What each of our nations does or does not do will not only impact us but people everywhere
For many of us perhaps all of us feel a strong sense of urgency
That's why we're here
We hope that will translate into making the progress necessary during this critical year and over this decisive decade
The consequences of falling short are clear every one of our countries is already experiencing the impact of climate change
And they'll only get worse
More frequent and more intense storms
Longer dry spells bigger floods more people displaced more pollution higher health costs and climate change can drive the spread of disease food insecurity mass migration and conflict
All of these consequences are hitting underserved and marginalized communities in our countries the hardest
Some countries are experiencing much more severe impacts than others
Something we must acknowledge and address
But as the president said it would be a mistake to think about climate only through the prism of threats
As we take concrete actions to reduce emissions and prepare for the unavoidable impacts of climate change we have an opportunity an opportunity to create sustainable good-paying jobs to promote not only greater growth but greater equity and to provide sustainable reliable affordable access to energy to more people which is crucial to every aspect of human development
So we're rooting for every country
Every business every community around the world to succeed in this effort
In that spirit as other countries strive to meet and raise their climate targets the United States will mobilize resources institutional knowledge and technical expertise from across our government the private sector civil society and research Universities to help
We want every country here to know we want to work with you to save our planet and we're all committed to finding every possible Avenue of cooperation on climate
If we work together we can do more than just address this crisis
We can turn it into an opportunity to improve our societies and deliver for people worldwide
And we can lay the foundation for cooperation on other shared challenges
There are many issues on which we don't all see eye to eye
This is not one of them
No matter what country we're from we know the world that we want to pass on to our children and our grandchildren
I can think of no better or more urgent cause to bring us together
It's now my honor to call on his excellency the secretary of the United Nations Antonio Guterres
Thank you President Biden for bringing us together to focus on the threat of climate change
You have started this summit by walking the talk and I admire the commitment of the United States to cut greenhouse emissions 50 to 52 by 2070
Mother nature is not waiting
The past decade was the hottest on record
Dangerous greenhouse gases are at levels not seen in 3 million years
Global temperatures have already risen 12 degrees Celsius raising towards the threshold of catastrophe
We see ever-rising sea levels devastating tropical cyclones and epic wildfires
We need a green planet but the world is on red alert
We are at the verge of the abyss
We must make sure the next step is in the right direction
Leaders everywhere must take action
First by building a global coalition for net zero emissions by mid century every country every region every city every company and every industry
Second by making this a decade of transtformationtransformatios should lay out actions and policies for the next ten years aligned with the 2050 net zero pathway
Third we need to translate those commitments into concrete immediate action
So far only 18 of 24 of pandemic recovery spending is expected to contribute to mitigating emissions reducing air pollution or strengthening natural capital
Trillions of dollars needed for Covid-19 recovery is money we are borrowing from future generations
We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden them with a mountain of debt or a broken planet
We must shift taxation from income to carbon and subsidies for fuels
Ramp up investments in renewable energy and green information
Stop the building of new coal power plants and phase out coal for the wealthiest countries and by 2040 for everywhere else
To build a truly global net zero coalition we need adaptation and this is critical for trust and collective action
Donors and multilateral national development banks must move from 20 to 50 climate flows in resilience
We need concrete proposals that provide technological support for countries
Excellencies young people are pushing their elders to do what is right
Women are on the front lines
More than 700 cities committed to net zero by 2050 I'm encouraged by the mobilization of the financial sector around the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero representing 70 trillion US dollars of assets
I call on all members to align as soon as possible behind the gold standard of credibility and ambition
Let us now mobilize political leadership to move ahead together to overcome climate change end the war on nature and have lives of dignity and prosperity for all
I thank you
Thank you Mr Secretary
It's my honor to call on the peoples republic of China his excellency Xi Jinping
Translator: We need to come together to Foster community of life for man and nature
First we must be committed to harmony between man and nature
All things that grow live in harmony and benefit from the nourishment of nature
Mother nature has nourished us we must treat nature as our root
Respect it
Protect it
Follow its laws
We should protect nature and preserve the environment like we protect our eyes
Second we must be committed to green development
Green mountains are gold mountains
To protect environment is to protect productivity and to improve environment is to boost productivity
The truth is as simple as that
We need to make sure that a sound environment is there to provide a sustainable and social development worldwide
Third we must be committed to systemic governance
Mountains rivers forests as well as farmlands lakes grasslands and deserts made indivisible parts of the ecosystem
We must properly balance all elements of nature and maintain overall balance in the ecosystem
Fourth we must be committed to a people-centered approach
Environment concerns the well-being of people in all countries
We need to take into full account peoples longing for a better life and good environment as well as our responsibility for future generations
We need to deliver social equity and justice in a cause of green transition and increase peoples sense of benefit happiness and security
Fifth we must be committed to multilateralism
We need to work on the basis of international law follow the principle of equity and justice and focus on effective actions
We need to uphold the UN-centered international system comply with the UN framework convention on climate change and its Paris Agreement and strive to deliver the 2030 agenda for sustainable development
Sixth we must be committed to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities
The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance
We need to give full recognition to developing countries contribution to climate action
And accommodate particular difficulties and concerns
Develop ed countries need to increase climate ambition and action and make concrete efforts to help countries accelerate to green and low-carbon development
Not long ago the Chinese and US sides released a joint statement regarding the climate crisis
China looks forward to join the advanced global environmental governance
Colleagues the Chinese civilization has always valued harmony between man and nature
There's been a constant pursuit of man and nature living in harmony with each other
China will follow the thought on ecological civilization and implement new development philosophy
We will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development
China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030
China has committed to move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in a much shorter time span than what might take developed countries
That requires hardests from China
Support has been given to localities sectors and companies
We will control projects
We will limit the period and phase it down in the 15th five-year period
China will host COP 15 of biological diversity and support COP 26 of the UNFCC in achieving positive outcomes
China will promote joint efforts to build a green belt and road to benefit the people of all countries
I'm confident that as long as we unite in our purposes and efforts we will rise above the global climate and environment challenges
And leave a clean and beautiful world to future generations
Thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
I now call upon the Prime Minister of the republic of In India
Your Excellency President Biden colleagues my fellow citizens of this planet I would like to thank President Biden for taking this initiative
Humanity is in a global pandemic right now
And this event is a timely reminder that the climate change has not disappeared
Climate change is a reality for millions around the world
Their lives and livelihoods are already facing its adverse consequences
Humanity must combat climate change
Concrete action is needed
We need such action at a high scale a large scale and with a global scale
We in India are doing our part
Our ambitions renewable energy target of 450 gigahertz by 2030 shows our commitment
Despite the challenges we have taken many more steps on clean energy energy efficiency and bio diversity
That's why we are among the few countries whose embassies are two degrees Celsius
We also encourage global initiatives like the coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure
Friends as a climate responsible developing country India welcomes partners to create templates of sustainable development in India
This can also help other developing countries who need affordable access to green and clean technologies
That is why President Biden and I are launching the India/US
climate and clean energy agenda Together we will help mobilize investment demonstrate clean technology and enable green collaborations
Friends I want to leave one part with you India's carbon footprint is 60 lower than the global average
O We are rooted in sustainable traditional practices
So today I want to emphasize the importance of lifestyle change in limit action
Sustainable lifestyles and guiding philosophy back to basics must be an important pillar of our economic strategy for the post-Covid era
Friends I recall the words of the great Indian Monk he called on us to arise awake and start now until the goal is reached
Let us make this decade of action against climate change
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr Prime Minister
Now the Prime Minister of the united kingdom and northern island Boris Johnson
Mr Prime Minister
Thank you very much
Your excellencies colleagues friends I would like to thank President Biden for bringing us together the way he has and for setting out the problem in the eloquent way that he did at the beginning and of course for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change
I'm really thrilled by the game-changing announcement that Joe Biden has just made
I'm very proud that the UK is doing the same
We were the first country to pass legislation for net zero
We have the biggest wind capacity still of any country in the world
The Saudi Arabia of wind
We're halfway to net zero
We have carbon emissions lower than any point since the 19th century
We're ending support for fossil fuels overseas and doubling our international climate finance
We're actually speeding up because we see the obligation as colleagues have just pointed out for developed countries to do more
We're legislating to deliver 78 of the reductions needed to reach that goal by 2035
And as host of COP 26 we want to see similar ambitions around the world
And we're working with everybody from the smallest nations to the biggest images to secure commitments that will keep change to within 15 degrees
And I think we can do it
To do it we need the scientists and all of our countries to work together to produce the technological solutions that humanity is going to need
Whether it's carbon capture and storage or solving the problems of cheap hydrogen delivery or getting to net zero flying making sure we can roll out EVs properly making sure our homes are stopping emitting such prodigious quantities of Co2
We can do this together across the world
And it's going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the 1$100 billion commitment that they already made in 2009
I stress how important that is
Plus -- I think what President Xi said nature is vital
If we're going to tackle climate change sustainably we have to deep with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet
We want to see more examples of government is and private industry working hand in hand as with the newly launched LEAF
coalition to reduce deforestation and the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero
To do these things we have to be constantly optimistic about new technology and new solutions whether that's super resistant crops crops that are super resistant to drought or more accurate weather forecasts like those we hope to see from the UK's new office 12 billion pound super computer that we're investing in
I'm not saying any of this is going to be easy
There is obviously going to be a political challenge
I think it's important to go back to the original words of President Biden
It's vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct green act of bunny hugging or however you want to put it
You know what I'm driving at
This is about growth and jobs
I think the president was absolutely right to stress that
I want to leave you with the thought that we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener
Don't forget the UK has been able to cut our own Co2 emissions by 42 on 1990 levels and we have seen our economy grow by 73
You can do both at once
Cake have eat is my message to you
Let's work together on this
Let's go to coming together in October and Glasgow in November armed with ambitious targets and the plans required to meet them
Let's use this extraordinary moment and the incredible t technology that we're working on to make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change and let's do it together
Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr Prime Minister
Now the Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga
Good morning
Good afternoon
I would like to take this opportunity to commend your leadership for holding this important summit
Extreme weather events such as torrential rains forest fires and heavy snow falls are witnessed worldwide in recent years climate change is set to be a major cause of such events
Responding to climate change and progressing decarbonization is an imminent challenge which the whole of human kind should aim to solve
At the same time our response to climate change is no longer a constraint on our economy rather it will be the driving force of a long-term dynamic growth of not only Japan but also of the whole world
With this vision in mind in the fall of last year I immediately after assuming my office as Prime Minister I declared that Japan will aim by net zero by We'll take a big step towards the resolution of this global issue
Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 46 in the fiscal year 2030 compared to the fiscal year 2013 as an ambitious target of a goal by net zero by Further more Japan will continue strenuousests iefforts cutting its emissions by 50
Such a goal of 46 in reductions would mean that Japan will raise our current target by more than 70 and it will certainly not be an easy task
However by defining a top-level ambitious target appropriate for the next growth strategy of a nation which underpins global manufacturing Japan is ready to demonstrate its leadership for world decarbonization
From now on we will accelerate our deliberations for establishing concrete measures towards achieving the target
Japan in order to create a virtuous cycle of the economy and the environment and to grow strongly towards our ambitious goal for 2030 we will work to maximize the utilization of de decarbonized sources like renewable energy and take incentive measures sufficient for inducing investment by companies
The national and subnational governments will work together to aim for achieving decarbonization in more than 100 national regions in 2070
Japan will work for the realization of innovation that will enhance production and secure sustainability in food agriculture and forestry sectors
Further more Japan will advance the transition to a circular economy thereby creating new industries and employment
Japan will continue its unseaunseat ing efforts towards 2030 and  Global decarbonization is what cannot be achieved by the efforts of one country alone
It is the challenge that requires a whole international community to be united as one
We can create global waves for climate change measures with ambitious targets presented and implemented by countries attending the summit today who responsible for around 80 of global emissions
Thereby overwhelming the whole world with our waves
Joe on the occasion of my recent visit to the United States last week I had the pleasure to confirm with you our commitment to lead the world decarbonization -- global decarbonization efforts
In more concrete terms Joe and I launched Japan/US
climate partnership on ambition decarbonization and clean energy
Based on this partnership Japan and the United States will work to promote worldwide decarbonization and continue cooperation in each area of the implementation of the Paris Agreement clean energy technologies and innovation and transition of developing countries including Indo-Pacific countries
Japan has provided public and private finance amounting to approximately 13 trillion Japanese yen approximately 118 billion US dollars
We announced that we will make contributions of up to 3 billion US dollars to the coalition
We will support the global transmission to decarbonization by maximizing the use of Japan's leading technologies in areas such as energy efficiency hydrogen and carbon capture and storage
In the area of adaptation Japan will promote international cooperation to address the impact hitting vulnerable states in the world
No other time than now does international society requireso decarbon society
Japan is determined to take the lead in solving the climate change for the whole of human kind by cooperating with each country and international organizations for the coming months leading up to COP 26 and beyond
Thank you for your attention
Pleasure to call upon the president of Canada Justin Trudeau
Thank you
Hello everyone
I want to begin by thanking President Biden for hosting this summit
Mr President thank you for your leadership on addressing the climate crisis and on other shared priorities in the fight against Covid-19 building a strong middle class
I'm encouraged to see so many countries coming together today to fight climate change
It's the only way to overcome the challenges people face in every part of our world
That's why it's also vital that we all work together to strengthen respect for international law reaffirm our collective commitment to human rights and stand up for people who face persecution abroad
Our collective success depends on finding a better path not only to a more sustainable future but to share peace and prosperity for everyone
Translator: Our priority continues to be combating Covid-19
We rely on science to save lives and develop vaccines but we must also listen to climate science which tells us that we are facing an existential thr threat
When Canadians elected us five years ago our emissions were projected to keep rising through 2030
With hard work and a solid plan Canada is now on track to blow past our old target of 30 reduction below 2005 levels
Last December we strengthened our climate plan to reduce more emissions including with a world-leading price on pollution
This week we made additional investments in the budget and today Canada is in a position to raise our climate ambition once again
Our new climate target for 2030 is to reduce our 2005 emission levels by 40 to 45
We will continually strengthen our plan and take even more actions on our journey to net zero by 2050
Translator: Only bold climate policies lead to bold results
For example you can no longer pollute in Canada for free
In 2030 our carbon price will reach $170 per ton
That's why we're investing in public transit clean energy retro fitting homes and decarbonizing industry like steel cement and aluminum to secure our industrial vantage
We're banning harmful single-use plastics protecting 30 of our oceans and land and planting 2 billion trees
We will make it law to respect our new 2030 target and achieve net zero emissions by 2050
That's our local story
It can be part of a global success story too
In Canada we worked hard to get to over 80 emissions-free electricity
We're not going to stop until we get to 100
If major economies in the room were to follow Canada's lead and adopt a rising price on pollution and commit to phase out coal plants we would accelerate our global path for a safe POSprosperous net-zero future
Translator: Canada is a country that produces and exports energy
So I understand this will not be easy
We are all facing different realities but if all government is and indigenous peoples and different sectors can come together and work together then we should be able to find solutions and create real change
And that is why we're here today
Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr Prime Minister
I now call upon the Prime Minister of the peoples republic of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina
Madam Prime Minister
Honorable president Joe Biden his excellency Antonio Guterres good morning
I thank President Biden for convening the summit and inviting me to speak to this panel
Bangladesh shares the Paris Climate Agreement
Excellencies despite being a climate vulnerable country with resource constraints Bangladesh has emerged as one leader and mitigation
Every year we are spending on an average 5 billion US dollars about 25 of our GDP on climate adaptation and resilience building measures
1 million displaced Uighurs from Myanmar who we have sheltered worsened or vulnerable
While pursuing a low-carbon development path we raised our national contribution indexes and adaptation emission we have incurred new sectors in addition to the existing energy industry and transport sectors in the mitigation process
We are planning to submit a wonderful ambitious plan by June 2021
Excellencies Bangladesh is marking the Annanniversary of -e are planting sapLINGS
As the chair of the climate vulnerable forum Bangladesh's key focus is to uphold the endurance of the climate vulnerable countries
We are hosting the subasian region of the global center on adaptation which is promoting locally-led adaptation solutions
The Covid-19 pandemic has demanded that a global crisis is only be addressed through strong collective response
As such responses of the members and as the chair of CBA I would like to make a few suggestions
Number one immediate and ambitious action plan by developed countries should reduce their carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise at 15 degree Celsius
The developing nations should also focus on mitigation matters
Number two ensuring the annual target of 100 billion US dollars which should be balanced 50/50 between adaptation and mitigation with spatial attention through the vulnerable countries while purs pursuing laws
Number three major economies international financial institutions and private sectors should come forward for climate financing as well as innovation and number four focus is needed on green economy and carbon-neutral technologies with technologies for developed nations
I thank you all
Thank you VE very much mad Prime Minister
Now Angela Merkel
Translator: Mr President Joe Biden dear colleagues I'm delighted to see the United States is back is back to work together with us in climate politics because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution if we really want to fulfill our ambitious goals
The national contribution of the United States for 2030 is a clear illustration of your ambitions
It's a very clear and important message to the international community
Thank you for this
Thank you for organizing this summit
This is a Herculean task
It's nothing short of a complete transformation complete change of the way we do business and the way we work
And Germany as you know has already reduced its emissions by 40 compared t ed to 1990 and th European union will be climate neutral by 2050
And we want to at least have 55 less emissions by 2030 compared to 1990
At the beginning of this week the EU adopted an agreement that sets this target as a binding one into law
And we as Germany will obviously give our contribution
We have actually described a policy that sets out a pathway towards climate neutrality
We think that Co2 pricing is the right way forward
That's why we have introduced a national emissions training for transport and heating and that's so far four sectors that have not been covered by EU emissions trading
Coal has been for us a very important resource but by the latest and I heard Antonio Guterres on that by the latest by 2038 we will phase out coal electrification and invest further into renewables
Already last year we produced electricity 46 of our electricity from renewables
We want to increase that
Necessary economic recovery after the pandemic is something we also want to use for innovation for technology
So we invest in renewables instead of in coal and we also see to it that the loss of bio diversity all over the world is stopped
We think we need to place 30 of the global land and marine surface under protection
We need primarily solidarity with the developing countries
As industrialized countries we committed ourselves to mobilize by 2020 an annual amount of 100 billion US dollars
And this is to be followed up by an extension until the very least 2025
Germany doubled its financing by 2022 4 billion euros per year
We're going to continue to contribute our fair share to this
With all of these measures we I think underline clearly that we are interested in a success of COP 26 in Glasgow this year and obviously also COP 15 we're talking about preserving biodiversity and in line with its tradition Germany is going to host together with the united kingdom the 12th petersburg climate tildialogue
And we are an active member and we are very much looking forward to cooperating with all of you
Thank you very much Chancellor Merkel
It's a pleasure to call upon the president of the French republic Emanuel Macron
Translator: Thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
I now turn the floor to the president of the Russian federation his excellency Vladimir Putin
The floor is now to the president of the Russian Federation Mr Vladimir Putin
Mr President
Ladies and gentlemen our discussion today demonstrates how deeply we all share the concern with regard to global climate change how much we're all interested in doubling the effort to address this issue
Whether this effort proves successful will largely determine the future of our planet the development prospects of each country as well as the well-being and political life of our citizens
We believe that there is a solid legal framework for international collaboration and controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions namely the universal agreements reached under the UN auspices
I'd like to stress that Russia treats its international commitments with the utmost responsibility in this sphere I refer in particular to the implementation of the UN Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement
We take active effort in Russia to build modern legislation that allows both controlling carbon emissions and creating incentives for their reduction
Yesterday I presented my annual address to the federal assembly of the Russian federation and among economic priorities I listed the task of significantly reducing the net emissions in our country by I'm confident despite Russia's size its geography climate and economic structure this task is achievable
We shouldn't forget as colleagues have already pointed out throughout this summit as compared to the 1990 level Russia reduced its greenhouse gas emissions to a greater extent than many other countries
Our emissions have halved dropping from 31 billion tons to 16 billion tons of Co2 This has become possible
But cause of a fundamental restructuring of our industry and energy that has been underway for the last two decades
As a result as of now 45 of our energy mix is accounted for by low emission energy sources including nuclear generation
And as is well known the greenhouse gases from nuclear power plants stand at now zero
We intend to further improve our capacities for using associated petroleum gas and carry out a large scale campaign for environmental modernization and greater energy efficiency across all economic sectors to ensure carbon capture storage and use for more sources
We're also building an infrastructure for producing hydrogen to be used both as a fuel and an energy source
I'd like to take note in that regard that Russia has launched a pilot project for creating a carbon pricing system and a mechanism for carbon trading
This project will allow this Russian region to become carbon neutral as soon as by 2025
It is no secret that the conditions that facilitated global warming and associated problems go way back
But what kind of comprehensive solutions can we see today
First carbon dioxide can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years
So it's not enough to ackle the issue of new emissions
It is a task of absorbing the CO2 that has accumulated in the atmosphere
Let me say that without exaggeration Russia makes a gigantic contribution to absorbing emissions in our ecosystems that are estimated at around 25 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per anum
Second we need to take into account each and every factor contributing to global warming
To cite an example methane accounts for 20 of all anthropogenic emissions and the greenhouse effect of a single ton of methane is 25 to 28 times stronger than that of a ton of CO2
So supposing we can have methane emissions in the next three decades experts project global temperatures to decrease by 2050 by 018 degrees centigrade which incidentally makes up for up to 45 of the difference between the current temperatures and the objectives under the Paris agreement
In this regard it would be imperative to force a broad and international cooperation in calculating and monitoring all harmful emissions into the atmosphere
We invite all those interested countries to join collaborative scientific research to jointly invest in climate projects that can make difference in real life and to actively pursue new low carbon technologies for mitigation and adaptation
Third I'm convinced that the fight for preserving our climate should certainly unit the efforts of the international community as a whole
Russia is willing to prepare us a whole range of joint projects and to consider potential benefits for foreign companies that would like to invest in clean technologies including in our countries
And lastly global development should not only be green it should also be sustainable in every sense of the word
And this applies to all countries without exception
Accordingly this development should go hand in hand with progress on such important tracks as fighting poverty and bridging development gaps between countries
In conCLUTION I would like to reiterate that Russia is genuinely interested in galvanizing international cooperation so as to look further for effective solutions to climate change as well as together other vital global challenges
Essentially it's the end goal of our today's video summit too
Thank you for your attention
Thank you very much president
We had some technical difficulties
So we want to return the floor to the president of France Emmanuel Macron
Translator: Methane emissions we are making progress
There is only one goal for the coming weeks and months to move more quickly
We need to move more quickly -- a plan of action that is clear measurable and verifiable
Basically 2030 is the new 2050
It is this plan that the European union put forward in December with its European green deal
It is therefore up to us to use all the levers available to us
Innovation transformation regulation
Let's move more quickly on our cooperation on innovation and disruptive technologies which will enable us to rise to the challenge and drive down our costs just like we have done in the area of solar energy and batteries
This will be a core action especially in the months ahead
A second lever we need to completely transform our financial system
In order to do this with a network for greening the financial system which the fed has just joined which is something I welcome with a task force on climate-related financial disclosures TCFS we have also taken all of us together in these last several years an extensive and transformative initiative
The one planet initiative has brought together sovereign funds
Asset managers and private equity so that everyone can use the same methodology
These initiatives have become models for the future and are changing global finance
France will shoulder all of its responsibilities in the coming months in order to go even further on the issue of this finance for climate
Taking action for the climate means regulating and regulating at an international level
If we don't set a price for carbon there will be no transition
Therefore we need to factor the environment in the cost investment in a regional investment in our regional markets and in our trade relations
There can be no credible and sustainable environmental action if there is no social and climate justice
To succeed collectively we need to move much more quickly to improve climate justice
That is the meaning behind the action we have taken with India and the international solar alliance
That is also why we are holding the summit on the financing of African economies in Paris on May 18
It is now up to us to establish a stronger mandate for our public banks in order to achieve net zero carbon emissions
-- is the same
The green wall accelerator shows that Africa contribute tackling causes and effects of climate change while boosting food security and job opportunities for its young people
All of these agendas are connected
It is up to us to take action
Thank you again Joe
It is up to us to take action for our generations and the generations to come
Thank you
We turn now to the president of the republic of Korea
Mr President Moon the floor is yours
Translator: Thank you very much
His excellency President Biden your excellencies
This evening on Earth Day the Korean people turn their lights off for ten minutes and heeded the whispers of the Earth
I hope that in support of Koreans we reach out to all the countries that are in the fight against climate change together
As we embark on the implementation of the Paris agreement this year President Biden has exerted global leadership by rejoining the Paris agreement and hosting this leader summit on climate
I express my deepest respect to the president and his administration for all their hard work
Your excellencies the people of Korea -- the challenges imposed by Covid-19 last year set the carbon neutrality by 2050
Today on behalf of the Korean people I am deeply pleased to make two pledges for achieving carbon neutrality
First the republic of Korea will further raise our national determined contribution for And submitted to the United Nations within this year
Last year we replaced our previous reduction target based on BAU with an absolute target of cutting 244 from 2017 emissions level making it our first operator adjustment
Now in a strong aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050 we hope to enhance our embassy once again
Korea reached peak greenhouse gas emissions in 2018
And in the ensuing two-year period from 2019 to 2020 reduced more than 10 of emissions from 2018 level
Second Korea will end our public financing for more overseas coal-fired plants
Since the launch of my government Korea has stopped issuing permits for building new domestic coal-powered plants shut down ten aged units earlier than schedule and as a result drastically reduced its reliance on coal for power generation
Instead we're swiftly ramping up the production of renewable energy such as solar and wind power to become carbon neutral it is imperative for the world to scale down coal-fired power plants
Yet developing countries that will struggle due to their heavy dependence on coal should be given due consideration and access to proper support
On the domestic front as well we need countermeasures for addressing the negative impacts to related industries businesses and jobs among others with a view to promoting investment for renewable energy facilities both in and outside Korea we will actively scale up
In coming May the second summit will be held in Seoul
Countries civil society industries as well as other diverse partners will come together accelerate their vision of carbon newt utrality
We will prepare for the summit that inspires an actionable vision and stronger cooperation
I ask for your key interest in participation so that the second summit becomes a stepping stone to a successful this coming November
Thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
We turn the floor now to the president of the republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo
Mr President the floor is yours
Thank you excellency President Biden for hosting this summit
The impact of climate change stands directly before us
Carbon 19 and the global recession further complicate these challenges
In this regard allow me to share three reflections
First Indonesia is serious in tackling climate change and calls upon the world to take concrete actions to lead by example
As the largest ARCHIPELAGIC country and home to tropical forests addressing climate change is Indonesia's national interest through policies empowerment in law enforcement
The rate of deforestation in Indonesia is at its lowest in the last 20 years
The moratorium on national forests and peatland conversion has covered 66 million hectares larger than the size of the UK and Norway combined
Forest fires have fallen by 82 at a time when some regions in the Americas Australia and Europe experienced the largest increase
Second we must advance green development for a better world
Indonesia has updated its NDC to enhance the capacity of climate adaptation and resilience
We welcome the upcoming UNNFCCC call 26 in the UK and look forward to an implementable and balanced outcome
We welcome several countries' target to achieve net zero emission by 2050
However to ensure its credibility such commitments should be implemented based on the 2030 NDC commitments
Developing countries will implement similar ambitions
If developed countries' commitments are credible accompanied by concrete support the fulfillment of commitment -- are indeed a necessity
Third to achieve the targets of the Paris agreement and other shared agenda global partnership must be strengthened must build understanding and strategies to reach net zero emissions and towards UNFCCC 26 glGLASGOW
Indonesia is accelerating its pilot projects for net zero emission including in the construction of Indonesia green industrial part covering an area of 12500 hectares in North CALIMANTAN which will become the largest in the world
We are rehabilitating 620000 hectares of mangroves by 2024 the largest in the world with four times carbon absorption compared to tropical forests
Indonesia is open to investments and transfer -- including for energy transitions -- there is also great opportunities in the development of biofuels lithium battery industry and electric vehicles
Indonesia's new presidency in 2022 will prioritize enhancing cooperation in climate change and sustainable development
Indonesia will continue to support the efforts of our friends in the Pacific
We should continuously advance concrete global partnership instead of attributing blame
-- trade barriers under the guise of environmental issues
Thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
The floor is now to the president of the republic of South Africa president Ramaphosa。 Ramaphosa
Thank you your excellency president Joe Biden and excellencies and ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to start off by thanking President Biden for convening this summit -- we're also delighted to have the United States back working with all of us to tackle the global challenge of climate change
Climate change is the most pressing issue of our time
It is a global phenomenon from which developing economies are particularly vulnerable especially on our African continent
Without effective adaptation climate change has the potential to reverse the developmental gains in many of the countries on the continent and push millions of people further into poverty and unemployment
In doing so we have to adhere to the principle of -- responsibilities and respective capabilities
Poor countries have historically contributed least to global emissions
Developing countries often suffer the most from the devastating effects of climate change particularly in the form of drought extreme storms and rising sea levels as well as floods
Consequently developed economies have a responsibility to support developing economies to enable them to mitigate and adapt to climate change
Significant progress can be made when we all are on a mutual commitment
We therefore need to emphasize the primacy of multilateralism in ensuring the full implementation of the UN framework convention on climate change
South Africa is fully committed in enhancing its ambition and accelerating its climate actions
Last year we finalized our national climate change adaptation strategy which coordinates all actions of government level and at national level
We have also adopted a low-emission development strategy in pursuit of a just transition to a low carbon sustainable and climate resilient developmental pathway
We are currently in the process of updating South Africa's nationally determined contribution
Our new NCD target ranges have been of public consultation
The new target ranges we are proposing are much more ambitious in two respects
Firstly the top range has been reduced by -- 174 million
Very significant reduction
Second according to our previous nationally determined contribution South Africa's emissions would peak and plateau in 2025 and decline from 2035
South Africa's emissions will begin to decline from 2025 effectively shifting our emissions' decline ten years earlier
With regard to our energy source we plan to build capacity to generate over 17 gigabytes of renewable energy by We remain committed to contributing our fair share to reduce global emissions and to do so in the context of overcoming poverty inequality and underdevelopment
The move towards no carbon climate resilient society cannot happen overnight
We need to work together to create a climate resilient -- amongst other things
We should firstly ensure that as we transit to a more climate resilient future it must be based on the just transition that ensures that those who are most -- do not get left behind
Secondly it is critical that all three of the goals of the Paris agreement is mitigation adaptation and finance to be advanced with equal determination and ambition
Thirdly we must support financing technology and capacity building
It will not be possible for developing economic countries including those in Africa to enhance ambition on either adaptation or mitigation
Fourthly it is important that aid on climate change should be provided separately and should not be part of conventional -- when it is given in the form of loan financing the debt burden of developing countries is worsened
We call on developed economies which historically bear the greatest responsibility for emissions to meet their responsibilities for developing economies
This will be vital to restoring the bonds of trust within developed and developing economies
As we have done since the time of our Revered leader Nelson Mandela South Africa stands ready to work with other nations to build brings to find solutions that legislature humanity's future
I thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
The floor is now to the president of the council administers of the Italian republic Mr Mario Draghi
I want to begin by thanking President Biden for his leadership in taking this initiative
As Chancellor Merkel just said it's a complete change
Now we are confident that together we can take on this challenge
President Biden mere colleagues as we fight the pandemic in our countries we cannot lose sight of the other cries we face
Tackling climate change in the Paris agreement we pledge to limit global warming to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels
The actions we've taken since have proven insufficient
Under current policies we are set to -- three degrees of global warming
We need to reverse course and do it soon
The fiscal plans we are designing to help our countries recover from the Covid-19 offer a unique opportunity
We can transform our economies and pursue a greener and more inclusive growth model
In Europe we launched a 750 billion Euro joint plan what we call the next generation EU
One of its objectives is to support the environmental transition in Europe and make the EU
carbon neutral by 2050
Around 10 of it roughly 70 billion Euros will go for investment in green infrastructures circular economy and sustainable mobility in Italy only
Italy is my own country is a beautiful but a fragile country
The fight against climate change is a fight for our history a fight for our landscapes
We need to frame our efforts towards sustainability within an effective and inclusive multilateral approach
Italy holds the presence of the G20 this year and the safeguard of our planet is the main objective of our program
G20 countries account for 75 of global emissions
We have a special responsibility in ensuring we deliver on the objectives of the Paris agreement
The Italian presidency has proposed to hold a joint climate and energy ministerial meeting
A strong result by the G20 will also boost the chances for a successful 26 conference in Glasgow
As the partner for the UK for 26 Italy is committed to give its contribution by hosting the pre-26 in Milan an event youth for climate
International climate finance plays also an important role in achieving these objectives
Italy has committed to set high targets for climate finance and to ensure their activities are aligned with the Paris agreement
We look forward to hosting the second edition of the financing summit of -- banks as part of the G20 presidency
We must also help the most vulnerable countries
Last December Italy pledged 30 million euros to the United Nations adaptation fund the climate commitments we make now will determine our chances of tackling climate change effectively in the next decade and beyond
We want to act now not to regret it later
Thank you
Thank you very much
We turn now to the president of the republic of the Marshall islands his excellency David Kabua
Greetings from the republic of the Marshall islands
Thank you President Biden for bringing us together
Our actions today have a direct bearing upon the future and security of my nation and for others in the Pacific and beyond
We are a low-lying atoll nation barely a meter above sea level
Our people have navigated between our islands to build thriving communities and cultures
Today we are navigating through the storm of climate change determined to do our part to steer the world to safety
We know what a safe harbor looks like
The Marshall islands would -- for years to create around a 15 degree celsius temperature goal
In 2015 we brought together the ambition coalition to turn the 15 to stay alive rallying cry that a call shared by OUL parties of the Paris agreement
It is important to ensure that 15 remains in reach
Our key task is to make sure that updated national emission commitments are in line with that goal
And this is where ambition moves from promise to plan keeping the worries today -- it is cite Y Al that we come together every five years to increase ambition
Our nation should also be charting long-term net zero strategies and implementation pathways before COP26
Too often countries hear the excuse that sustain emission costs are too costly
But political signals especially from the major economies shape decisions on investment and innovation for low carbon pathways
Now is the moment for the signal to be unequivocal
The recovery from Covid-19 gives us a rare chance to invest in a stable and healthier world
Sectorwide transformation are possible together with the Solomon islands we are pushing for stronger emission action at the IMO through a carbon levy to fund research and help the most vulnerable
Leading from front lines we were the first to strengthen our indices in 2018
And we have a 2015 net zero strategy paired with an electricity road map as our implementation pathway
We recently celebrated the success of the -- challenge and we'll be joining the local 2020 islands network
But all our actions will not be enough
If we fail to act we feel the effects of climate change now
And so we are also leading the way to adaptation
And on developing our national adaptation plan
Adequate and accessible financing is key
And so I support the call for 50 of climate financing for adaptation
I will conclude by asking my fellow leaders how will you move from plans to implementation to align with a 15 degree future and help others do the same
Your answer will define the future for your children and grandchildren and for mine
Thank you very much Mr President
President Biden we know you have to step away for a few moments
We look forward to having you back here shortly
But any words before you depart
I apologize for having to leave for a few minutes
I'll be back shortly
But it's an encouraging start
There's a lot to do
I get the feeling that we are really beginning to make some real progress
So I'm looking forward to hearing more
Thanks Mr President
The floor is now to the president of the Argentine republic his excellency Alberto Fernandez
Mr President
Good morning from all of you
Thank you so much for the invitation given to me by President Biden
Today is the Earth Day
We have to work together
I am so happy that the US is reinvesting again
Argentina considers the climate change as a key issue as 50 years ago -- said we have to be aware of the suicidal path that we are -- because of the contamination
It's now or never
In Argentina we part of the Paris agreement and we included in our national cabinet climate change as one of our ministers so that they can set up the mitigation plan that is going to be submitted to the COP26 in Glasgow
Therefore what we are going to say first we are going to increase our contribution 27 vis-a-vis 19 the 2016
There are two additional issues of what we submitted in 2016
This coincides with the objective of 115 centigrade and net zero emission
We are committed to develop 30 of our energy network with renewables
And we have a plan very efficient for the industry transportation construction
We will promote the adaptation of technologies to reduce methane emissions and c contaminants
We will also have a plan to export hydrogen
We will adapt very deep measures to eradicate illegal deforestation
And it will be classified as a crime
We will have a new Bill to protect native forests
And we will also promote the rapid law of education regarding environment of issues
We have to work together
And we have to remember what our Pope Francis says
The social and ecological crisis are two faces of the same issue
They are linked
And as president Macron just said we need to renew the financial architecture the agenda is very -- we have to have soft loans with bilateral and multilateral banks
We have to pay for services and swap of debt for environment of actions
We cannot discriminate those countries that are the medium-sized countries
And we have to make sure that the qualified and the agents that qualify our countries have to be aware of what -- are
And the issues that make our countries go into debt in this case due to the covid
And we have to have better terms of payment
Therefore I hope that out of this summit we have a new path
This is a time to dream
I talked to all my colleagues in Latin America
We have to coordinate regional measures social measures
The new generations are looking at us
We cannot doubt anymore
Nobody can work by himself or herself
We have to work together
We have to have social justice financial justice and environmental justice
Thank you very much
Floor to the president of the European commission Ursula
President Biden excellent
Ladies and gentlemen a little over five years ago the world came together to sign the Paris agreement
Today we have to strengthen that global unity around ambitious new goals
Because this will be the make-or-break decade for our climate
And therefore I want to thank President Biden for convening this meeting on Earth Day
The Paris agreement is human ant's life insurance
And at the COP26 in Glasgow we must show that we all have understood this and that we are ready for more climate action
Because we are getting dangerously close to 15 degrees of global warming
Science tells us it's not too late yet but we must hurry up
And that is what Europe is doing
11 days after taking office my commission launched the European green deal for transforming our economy
And yesterday we agreed Europe's first-ever climate law with the European parliament and our 27 governments as Angela Merkel mentioned
With this we write into stone the goal to set out by the European green deal to make Europe climate neutral by 2050
And we have also agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 by 2030
In June my commission will table proposals to make Europe fit for 55
We will make emission training work not only for generation work and industry but also for transport and for buildings
Carbon must have its price because nature cannot pay the price any longer
But fit for 55 is not just about emissions
We will safeguard our nature and enhance biodiversity
Going for nature-based solutions wherever possible
And we will ensure that all this is done in a just and inclusive way
Because for our ambition to succeed we must leave nobody behind
Climate action is also a massive opportunity for our economies
It creates new markets and mobilizes investments in new and transforming industries
And it unleashes innovation for a healthier and more prosperous future
And this is why 30 of Europe's recovery plan next generation all together 18 trillion Euro is earmarked for climate-related goals
The fight against climate change will be the engine for our global recovery
And it will be our compass for cooperation with all of you in many areas in research innovation and breakthrough technologies through forums like mission innovation or in helping vulnerable countries to become resilient to climate change
Europe wants to be the first climate neutral continent in the world
But to save the climate we need the world
We need all major economies to take their responsibility and to turn the transition into an opportunity for all
Let's set together a new global benchmark for climate neutrality
Let us work together on a shared commitment a joint action for reducing emissions by 2030
This puts us on a pathway to net zero emissions by 2050
And that is what our planet needs
Thank you again President Biden for this meeting
It is so good to have the US back on our side in the fight against climate change
Together we can go faster and get further
And together we will win the future
Thank you very much Madam president
I now turn to the floor to his majesty king Salman custodian of the two holy mosques and king of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Your majesties highnesses and excellencies
Deep participants from the beginning we would like to thank President Biden for holding this summit to combat climate change which threatens life on our planet
These challenges recognize on national borders the objective is sustainable development
And in order to achieve this there must be a comprehensive methodology that takes into account the different development of circumstances that exist around the world
In accordance with the Saudi vision 2030 we have launched packages of strategies and regulations such as the national environmental strategy with the aim of producing with the aim of producing 50 of the kingdom's energy need by 2030 using clean renewable sources
Enhancing the level of international cooperation is the optimal solution to meeting the challenges of climate change
During our G20 presidency last year we advocated the need to adopt the notion of a circular carbon economy launching two international initiatives to curb land degradation and to protect coral reefs
More recently his royal highness the crown prince announced two new initiatives the Saudi initiative Middle East green initiative which aim at reducing carbon emissions in the region by more than 10 of global contributions
These initiatives also aim at planting -- billion trees in the region in addition to a number of unique initiatives
These two initiatives have been endorsed by the international community
We will work with our partners to achieve their goals by hosting this year the green Saudi initiative forum and the Middle East green initiative summit
Finally we would like to affirm our keenness on and commitment to cooperation -- climate change in order to create a better environment for future generations wishing success for our efforts for our effort to protect the planet
And may peacing with you
Thank you very much your majesty
The floor is now to the president of the federal republic of Brazil president Bolsonaro
Mr President
Heads of state heads of government ladies and gentlemen president Joe Biden I thank you very much for the invitation to take part in this summit leaders
Historically Brazil has been an active voice in efforts to build a global environmental agenda
Today I renew our credentials which are supported not only by our achievements so far but also by the commitments that we stand ready to take on for future generations
As the home of the planet's greatest biodiversity and as an environmental power house Brazil is at the very forefront of efforts to tackle global warming
As we get together to discuss climate change we cannot possibly forget the major cause of the problem at hand and that is the burning of fossil fuels in the course of the past two centuries
Brazil has accounted for less than 1 of the historic greenhouse gas emissions even as one of the world's largest economies
Currently this accounts for less than 3 of annual global emissions
We have in place one of the cleanest -- in the world marked by renewed investments in solar wind hydro and biomass-based energy
We are a pioneering country in the dissemination of biofuels renewable biofuels such as ethanol which help clean up our urban centers
In the countryside we have promoted a green revolution based on science and innovation
We produce more using less resources which makes Brazil an agriculture one of the most sustainable practices on the planet
We are proud to conserve 84 of the Brazilian Amazonian biome and 12 of the Earth's drinking water resources
As a result in the past 15 years alone we have -- the emission of more than 78 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere
In the light of our common but differentiated responsibilities we continue to collaborate towards global efforts against climate change
We are one of the few developing countries to adopt and to reaffirm a cross-cutting and comprehensive NDC including absolute targets for reducing emissions even already for 2025 by 37 and a reduction of up to 40 by 2030
Mr President we could not agree more with your call for establishing ambitious commitments on the climate agenda
Accordingly I have determined that our climate neutrality in Brazil be achieved -- therefore bringing forward by ten years the previously announced commitment levels
Among the measures that are required to that end may I highlight here our commitment to eliminate illegal deforestation in Brazil by 2030
With full and prompt enforcement of the Brazilian force code
With that we will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50 by that date
One must recognize that this will be a complex task
Command and control measures are part of the response
Despite our administration's budget constraints I have nevertheless determined that the environmental bodies be further strengthened thereby doubling funds allocated to inspection actions
But it is necessary to do more
We must face the challenge of improving the life of more than 23 million Brazilians who live in the Amazonian region
The country's richest nation as far as natural resources are concerned
But again a region boasting the worst human development indices
Overcoming the so-called Amazonian paradox or contradiction is a key and essential condition for sustainable development in that region
We must also enhance land governess and make the bioeconomy a reality by truly acknowledging the value of the forests and biodiversity
This must be an effort that will accompany the effort of all Brazilians to include indigenous peoples and traditional communities
In view of the magnitude of these obstacles including financial obstacles it is key that we be able to count on the contribution of companies
The business community institutions and people willing to act immediately as well as in a real and constructive fashion towards the solution to these problems
-- have a unique opportunity to collaborate towards efforts to build our common future
COP26 will have as one of its main missions the task of fully adopting the mechanisms under articles 5 and 6 of the Paris agreement
Carbon markets are critical as a source of funds and investments to propel and boost our climate action not only in forests but also in other relevant sectors of the economy such as industrial activity power generation and waste management
Likewise there must be fair payment for environmental services provided by our biomes to the planet at large as a way to recognize the economic nature of environmental conservation activities
As I said before and stress now we stand ready and remain open to international cooperation
Ladies and gentlemen as we have all affirmed back in 1992 in the Rio De Janeiro during the Earth summit a conference chaired by Brazil the right to development must be materialized in such a way as to equitably and sustainably respond to environmental and development needs of both current and future generations
It is with that spirit of collective responsibility and a shared future that I invite you all again today to support us in this mission
You can certainly count on Brazil
Thank you very much
Mr President thank you very much
We turn now to the prime minister of Bhutan prime minister Tshering
The floor is yours
Your majesty excellencies ladies and gentlemen I bring you warm greetings from his majesty the king your majesty the green from Bhutan
And I thank you President Biden for inviting Bhutan and allowing our voice to be heard at this important gathering
I also commend President Biden for bringing the United States back to the Paris agreement
I feel that leadership will be important in bringing the major economic leaders together to achieve our plan for a healthy planet
Excellencies in Bhutan all our developmental activities are guided by the measure of happiness
Balances gross socioeconomic development with that of environmental and cultural conservation
In line with the principles of GNH our constitution mandates us to maintain at least 60 of our total area on the forest cover for all times to come
As of today the actual forest cover is about 71 with more than 50 of the land protected as national parks wildlife sanctwearies and biological interests
Our main source of energy is hydropower
We are not just carbon neutral but carbon negative
Our constitution also requires us to maintain intergenerational equity when it comes to natural resources
These environmental credentials have originated from the golden throne and they're legally binding
What more indices can we place
Yet -- complacency
We are drafting our second embassy which will be even more ambitious
This is a clear indication that those economically challenged we have realized beyond doubt the sustainable development part is the right way in the long run
But even though efforts remain highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change we fear increasing threats from weather events I cannot understand this irony of contributing a lot environment preservation yet having to suffer so much
Despite our own challenges as chair of the NDC we have tried our best
Last December we hosted the summit to build political momentum on climate action
The commitment made by Bhutan and other agencies represent a small fraction of what is needed to reduce emissions by 2030
We urge all countries to set more ambitious targets well ahead of COP26
Climate finance is key to leverage climate actions and to implement the enhanced -- of the developing countries
Therefore delivery of the $100 billion per year commitment is critical
At the same time COP26 should begin deliberations on the new finance goal
This should be based on science and the needs of the developing countries
It must also be complimented with the transfer of green technologies which are environmentally sustainable disaster resilient and contribute to green development
Excellencies in raising our climate ambitious Bhutan is ready for climate action on the ground
We have mainstreamed climate action into all our developmental plans and are formulating enhanced indices and a long-term strategy to enhance vision carbon neutral for all times to come
But we need the global community to support our resolve
Governments bilateral institutions banks private sectors and the scientific community must come together before it is too late
We would now like to see major economies provide leadership for some real action on the ground
I thank you all
Thank you very much Mr Prime minister
It's a pleasure now to call upon the prime minister of Australia prime minister Scott Morrison
Mr Prime minister I'm not sure we're hearing you
We are well on the way to meet and beat our Paris commitments and will update our long-term emissions reduction strategy for Glasgow
Achieving our 2030 target we'll see emissions per capita fall by almost half of our emissions commitment of GDP by 70
Already we have reduced our emissions by 19 on 2005 levels
More than most other similar economies
And by 36 when you exclude exports
We are applying renewable energy ten times faster than the global average per person
We have the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world
Australia is on the pathway to net zero
Our goal is to get there as soon as we possibly can through technology that enables and transforms our industries
Not taxes that eliminate them and the jobs and livelihoods they support and create especially in our region
For Australia it's not a question of when or if but importantly how
That is why we are investing in new priority technology solutions through our technology initiative
We're investing around $20 billion to achieve ambitious goals that will bring the cost of clean hydrogen -- carbon capture to commercial parity
We expect this to leverage more than $80 billion in the investment in the decade ahead
Cheapest green hydrogen in the world
Mr President United States you have the Silicon valley
Here in Australia we are creating our own hydrogen -- where we will transform our mining and resource sectors manufacturing our fuel and energy production
In Australia our journey to net zero is being led by world-class pioneering Australian companies led by Dr Andrew forest
Busy BHP Rio tinto AGO and so many more of all sizes
It is also being pioneered by our agricultural and Marine sectors through soil science and sustainable fisheries
Marine protected areas in Australia are approaching 40 of our waters
We have already funded over a hundred cutting-edge products to support the great barrier reef and are committing a further $100 million to protect our oceans coastal ecosystems to mitigate climate change
We are also providing $15 billion in practical climate finance focusing on our blue Pacific family partners in our region
Mr President we want to work with others on the how through our new international technology partnership program my government is committed to playing its part in making COP26 a success in Glasgow
And you can always be sure that the commitments Australia makes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are bankable
We have proven performance
Transparent emissions accounting and transformative technology targets to unlock pathways to net zero
Future generations my colleagues and excellencies will thank us not for what we have promised but what we deliver
And on that score Australia can always be relied upon
Thank you for your kind attention
Thank you very much Mr Prime minister
It's a pleasure now to turn to the prime minister of ANTIGUA and BARBUDA
I thank President Biden for convening this very important gathering to address the most significant threat facing our one planet and our one humanity
We are grateful that the United States and China have pledged to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
And we look forward to swift action in the transitioning into carbon neutral economies
We urge other emitting nations to follow this vital example set by the United States and China
The 44 members of the alliance of small island states through no-fault of their own confront the greatest threats of climate change
The 44 -- members are the least contributors to greenhouse gas emissions but the most affected by climate change
Collectively they emit just 15 of emissions of industrialization
And many of them have already begun to roll out ambitious programs to reduce their small carbon footprint particularly in renewable energy
We made ambitious national commitments at COP21 in Paris and they remain passionately committed to implementing them within their means
However the harmful effects of climate change are growing
And the cost of mitigation and recovery is being counted in human lives and livelihoods
Economic situation of our countries was already grave before the Covid-19 pandemic
It is now dire particularly for tourism-dependent nations
We are literally teetering on the edge of despair
Over the years the debt of small states has risen to unsustainable levels because of repeated -- to rebuild and recover from continuous debilitation by natural disasters arising from climate change
Mechanisms introduced by the international financial institutions for addressing the looming debt crisis are insufficient
For some small states even these inadequate instruments are denied because of the false criterion of middle and high income which ignores the huge vulnerabilities that small states face
It is urgent that policymakers of the IFIs instruct that more determining criteria of small size resource constraint and vulnerabilities be taken fully into account for concessional financing
Colleagues repayment of official debt by small states including to the Paris club is near impossible in the prevailing circumstances
A permanent solution to the looming debt crisis is compelling and necessary
This requires action to design new and innovative financial instruments and to provide debt relief including debt cancelation debt suspension debt rescheduling debt restructuring and debt for climate swabs
Worsening climate conditions are up rooting workers from previously productive sectors and causing a crisis of immigration and refugees
This too must be reversed in global interest
We should acknowledge the interconnectedness of our human civilization
And we need to respect and protect our common humanity
Providing revenues and employment for larger -- every major country benefits from -- small states
Vital markets democracies rule of law
To achieve climate justice and to provide economic conditions that discourage refugees we need the following
We need urgent access to Covid-19 vaccines which -- vulnerability
We need immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions
A program of debt forgiveness and debt rescheduling
Concessional financing that takes account of vulnerabilities and funding to compensate for damage to help to reconstruct economies and funding to acquire decarbonized technologies and building resilience
Excellencies it is our hope that the spirit of cooperation will emerge from this gathering of 40 that can be taken to Glasgow to inspire an ambitious program of action to achieve -- by 2050
I thank you
Mr Prime minister thank you very much
It's now a pleasure to call upon the president of the united Mexican states Obrador
Translator: Explaining that even though we have discovered three very important hydrocarbon deposits the oil that we are discovering now will be used basically to satisfy domestic demand
And we will not export crude oil
And by gasoline
Therefore we will avoid the excessive use of fossil fuels
We are also updating our hydroelectric plants to reduce the use of carbon in the production of electricity
The energy that is produced with water is clean and is cheap
Therefore we have decided that we would change all turbines for very updated equipment
And therefore this will allow us to be able to take advantage of the waters that we have -- we will be able to produce more energy without building new dams and without affecting the environment
The third proposal is to share with you especially with you President Biden a very successful experience that we had
We are currently implementing the program -- and maybe this is the largest effort of reforest relation we have seen in the world
Therefore we can say that we have 450000 agricultural workers that receive 5000 PESOS a month to be able to plant fruit trees in their lands
We have planted 700 million plants and we will reach 1 billion to be able to cover 1 million hectares
29000 $14 billion
The proposal is that together we will expand that program in the South of Mexico and in Central America so that we will be able 3 billion additional plans
And to generate 1000200 jobs
We assume economic responsibility and we are committed to help in organizing this
And you President Biden will be able to finance this program sowing life in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador
We have to take into account that with 4 million hectares of trees we can absorb 70 million tons of CO2 per year
I just want to add another proposal very respectful
The US government could offer to those that participate in this program that maybe after working in the wetlands for three consecutive years they would be able to get a temporary working permit and after three or four more years maybe they could obtain even legal residency in the US or keep double nationality
So the migration phenomenon as we all are aware of is not going to be solved by force
But with justice and well-being
You President Biden is a very sensitive person
And you know very well that the spirit of work that desires to improve is fundamental for the development of nations
Migrants are exceptional people
And those are the people that help in the development of measures
We have to organize them in a very human way and in a very practical manner
And the responsibility to give to the future generations a planet where they can be able to live
We also have to think that we are brothers in a universal way
Thank you so very much
Thank you very much president Obrador
I'd now like to turn to the president of the -- republic
Mr President excellencies and ladies and gentlemen
In precedented changes causing unseasonable and extreme weather conditions increasing the effects for millions around the world
Food production systems and water supplies are threatened
Over half of Africa's countries are predicted to experience climate-driven conflict
Around the world forests are burning
The Congo basin one of Earth's billions of tons of carbon
-- to restrict global warming 15 degrees
Fortunately they tell us that the Congo basin is more resilient to the effects of climate change than other tropical rainforests
Excellence ladies and gentlemen GABON has 88 forest cover with low -- we are well on our way to achieving 30 protected areas by 2030
We are net carbon positive absorbing four times CO2 than we admit
By investing in sustainable forestry we can create a green economy that generates jobs and livelihoods while preserving forests
A nature-based solution to fight climate change with massive -- for biodiversity and climate
However we live in a climate democracy
And no individual country can escape the catastrophic results of our collective actions
Africa only contributes a fraction of global emissions but we are the continent which is paying the biggest price
It is therefore crucial that climate finance including climate -- be used to bring equity to the cause of adaptation in Africa
That is why the African heads of state form the African adaptation initiative in Paris
And that is why just two weeks ago African heads of state came together to launch a program -- Africa calls itself on the developed nations to shoulder your responsibility -- the GCF
I congratulate Joe Biden for his leadership
We are on course for disaster
It is our collective responsibility to act immediately and at an unprecedented global scale to limit the climate change crisis
There is no time to lose
I thank you
Thank you very much Mr President
I now give the floor to the president of the republic of Colombia president Duque
President Biden secretary blinken it is an honor for me to be part of this marvelous meeting
And I want to start by saying that there is no doubt that climate change is the main challenge of our times
A country like Colombia represents 06 of the greenhouse effect at the global level
However we are among the 20 more vulnerable countries due to climate change
Vis-a-vis that reality we have to be bold be decisive and we have to act now
And this is why Colombia has been very clear in that when we go to Glasgow we make two commitments
First that we will get to 2030 reducing 51 of our greenhouse gases
And we have established that goal to neutral carbon for 2050
These are not just promises
These are objectives that are based on the actions that we are taking from now on
First of all it's regarding the energy transformation when we took over only 05 of our electrical grid was fed by renewable energy
And our objective based on the decisions that we have taken is that for August of next year we will have 14 of that
So this jump is very very impressive
Second is to go into cleaner energies thanks to the incentive that we have created we already have the urban electrical fleet the largest one in central -- in Latin America and the cargo transportation as well
We also took measures in the fight against deforestation and we are going to plant 50 million plants by the end of 2022
And in December of this year we will have more than 100 million trees planted
This is a circular economy where we have to produce by conserving and conserve by producing
And it is -- and this will affect the different industries
We also started initiative with different countries that are present here today in the work in the Amazon region
And we have no doubt that in the solution of nature base would be very very positive
And we have to start signing the contracts for the protection of our environment
I have to mention that we have to have 21st century environmental ethics where we have to urge our kids and our young people that we are aware on how to reduce our carbon footprint
And I want to take advantage of this opportunity President Biden and secretary blinken
It's very important that all of us present we have to subscribe to the agreement of the protection of the environment
There are 74 countries that have already signed this
But we want more countries to sign this
It is very important to use the development institutions like the inter-America development bank that will finance these policies so that we can get to net zero
And the third I just wanted to share with you that it's very urgent that we have new mechanisms so that we can have debt for adoption swap
And I would like to by closing President Biden secretary blinken 50 of our territory is forest
We are representative of 6 of the Amazon basin
We are the second country in the world with more biodiversity per square kilometer and we have 50 of the high mountain environment
Our fight our contribution in fighting this climate change is to protect that treasure
And if Colombia that represents only 06 of the greenhouse effect establishes a goal to reduce it by 51 by 2030 we hope that those actions will also be supported and be as an example of countries that are the head contributors
And the only way to save our planet would be to work together
We have to be aware that the issue of sustainability is what we have to follow
Thank you so very much
Thank you very much Mr President
It's now a pleasure to call upon the president of the republic of turkey president Erdogan the floor is yours
Distinguished heads of state and government I would like to greet you with my most heartfelt feelings on behalf of myself my nation and my country
I would like to thank Mr Biden the president of the United States of America for organizing this very meaningful event and for the invitation
It is all of us moral and conscientious duty to leave the world that has been entrusted to us in a more liveable manner to the next generations
Climate change is not only affecting certain states that are most polluting the world but actually it is affecting the whole humanity starting with the countries in the African continent
And as turkey we are also among the countries that have been most affected by the negative impact
In order to reduce the impact of climate change we are actually taking intensive action
We are undertaking significant investment to increase the forest area of our country and to increase our forest stock to further develop biodiversity and conserve the environment
As a matter of fact we have planted a total of 51 billion saplings in the last 18 years and we have increased our forest stock from 208 million hectares to 23 million hectares
And we are updating our national climate change strategy and action plan and the climate change adaptation strategy and action plan which constitute our road map in the fight against climate change in line with 2030 and 2050 goals
Within the framework of our nationally determined contribution that we had presented in 2015 we are expecting reduction of our greenhouse gas emission up to 21 up until 2030
According to our nationally determined contribution a total of 1000000920 million tons of greenhouse emission will be prevented from the years of 2012 until 2030
Turkey is actually a leading country in its region when it comes to renewable energy
Currently the electricity installed power has a share of 523 of renewable energy
With this rate we rank the sixth in Europe and the 13th around the world
And in terms of hydroelectric plant installed power we rank the second in Europe and ninth around the world
And we will be increasing our -- solar power to ten Gigowatts
And thanks to the steps we will be taking for energy efficiency we are targeting to have 666 million tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction by Under the leadership of the first lady Madam Erogan we are going to increase the recycling rate to 30
We are a country surrounded on three sides of sea and the issue of declaring protection zones in open seas is an issue that we need to take into our agenda
In relation to fighting against climate change any action and any undertaking that we will be taking is requiring high level of investment
In the post-Covid-19 pandemic period we do believe that a green transformation will be at the core of our recovery
And we are taking steps to -- the green transformation of the industrial sector is also one of the aspects that I have announced in the economic reform package that I declared in March
Of course such a transformation is creating the need for investment and financial opportunities
No government or no sector can actually realize such a large transformation on their own
And we know this very clearly
Thus starting from the green transformation and in other areas we do believe that that strategic cooperation that is going to be established at the global level is of utmost importance
I do believe in the efforts of President Biden is to be appreciated especially in regards to this aspect
Climate change is a global phenomena and of course unfortunately countries are not at an equal footing
We see developing and developed countries
And I do believe that the sharing of the burden amongst these countries should be created in an equal manner and this is going to be strengthening our fight against the climate change
In the pathway towards 2030 the common but differentiated responsibilities and comparative skills of principle is going to be the main basis of an equal footing and an equal framework
In relation to the greenhouse gas emissions turkey does not have much of an historical responsibility
But we do believe that turkey needs to be at an equal footing in relation to the global climate change regime
We will be continuing to participate in the global climate efforts to be on an equal footing with countries at the same economic level
I would like to wish the summit to be bringing beneficial results for future generations
And I would like to thank each and every one of you who have participated in the organization and greet each and every one of you with my heartfelt feelings
Thank you Mr President
We turn now to the president of Chile president Pinera
Thank you very much
Your excellency I am honored to address to you today and I am also thankful to President Biden and a special envoy carry for organizing this event in which we can amass strength our commitments to fight climate change and global warming
As you all know the Covid-19 pandemic is not the only trek that humanity faces today
Climate change has continued its advance at a speed that urges us to take actions today
So my man kind can have a tomorrow
Chile is ready to do its part
Even though we are a small country responsible for only 025 of the total world's emissions we are determined to have a significant and positive impact and to make a relevant contribution in our fight against climate change
How does a small country like Chile -- the answer is simple and can be found in the simplest of molecules hydrogen
Green hydrogen is what Chile can offer to the international community
Provide us with the resources required
In the North the Atacama desert receives the strongest radiation
While in the South the Patagonia we have some of the strongest winds on Earth
Once harnessed these resources will allow us not only to decarbonize our own energy matrix before 2040
But also will allow us to become a neutral carbon country before And we will become the most efficient productER of green hydrogen in the world
As we move towards cleaner forms of energy we must not neglect the protection of some of the most vulnerable and exploited areas of our planet the oceans
COP26 will be the blueprint to underscore the role of oceans the role oceans play as a climate regulator agent
And importance of the protection Chile has already established Marine protected areas that cover over 43 of our exclusive economic soil
But it's not enough
And that's why today I want to invite you to go further by asking you to join Chile in two proposals
First the establishment of the Marine protected area in Antarctica as we have proposed alongside with Argentina
This would protect the ocean around the Antarctic peninsula home to an incredible biodiversity including endangered species such as penguins whales seals krill and small crustaceans which serve as the foundation of the ocean food chain
And second the creation of the first Marine protected area in the high seas specifically in the NAZCA region an area identified as fabulously rich in biodiversity abundant in endemic species and which has been designated as an ecologically and biologically significant area under the United Nations convention on biological diversity
We are decarbonizing our electric network
We are becoming a carbon neutral country
And we are electrifying our transportation system
I want to share with you the climate change project
Under this initiative we will create an integrated network of multiparametric sensors installed throughout the country covering more than 8000 kilometers from the North border and close to the South pole
All the data collected will be publicly available to the world's scientific community and to any interested person
The fight against climate change and global warming can not wait
Science has spoken loud and clear
Our citizens are asking us to change the course of history
And science and technology provide us with that
Chile has heard the message and has taken bold actions
In all your efforts to tackle this threat you will always have a committed partner in Chile
We always -- but most of all we owe it to future generations
Thank you very much
Mr President thank you very much
And now it's a true pleasure and honor to introduce another leader climate activist SHIA BASTIBA
SHIA grew up in the town of San Pedro in Mexico
She's experienced first hand the devastating impact of climate crisis
When SHAY was just 11 years old her town was hit by back-to-back years of climate-driven drought
Then the intense rains came and then the floods
Her family was displaced and she and her parents relocated to the United States to New York
These dramatic swings in extreme weather are just one of the consequences of the climate crisis we're already experiencing across the world including here in the United States where at the same time as her town was experiencing droughts and floods the American southwest was in the middle of the worst drought since the 16th century
After relocating to New York Shia came face to face with another impact of the climate crisis in the lasting damage left by super storm sandy
Wherever she went she saw how change is driven by climate were hurting communities
She had joined the Fridays for the future movement and was one of the young activists who led the fellow students and people of all ages to strike in order to wake up the world to the impacts of the climate emergency and to call on leaders like us to take action before it's too late
In the time since she's given much of herself to the climate justice effort
She mobilized 600 students from her school to join the March 2019 climate strike
-- state
She launched a youth activism training program
She addressed the United Nations
This isn't a hobby for her it's a way of life
She is part of a rising generation of leaders who are pushing us to make the necessary changes that we put off for too long
She and her fellow young leaders have earned a seat at the table not just because they will bear more of the consequences of climate change or the world's inaction on climate but also because of the urgency ingenuity and total dedication that they have brought to this effort
We've asked a lot of our young people they're delivering
Now it's time we ask more of ourselves
She comes from a line of environmental activists
Her grandparents fought for decades to protect her indigenous sacred lands
Something her father told her continues to guide her activism to this day
I quote
Leave everything better than you found it
That's also our responsibility
It's what this summit is all about
And it's the underlying purpose behind all that we must do in this crucial year in this decisive decade
If we act together we can turn the need to reduce our emissions and adapt our communities into once in generations opportunity to improve the lives of our people and build more just equitable and sustainable societies
SHIA thank you for all you've done to leave everything better than you found it
We're humbled and inspired by your service
And now we look forward to hearing from you
Thank you
Excellences President Biden and honorable heads of state my name is SHIA BASTILLA
I am a climate justice activist born and raised in Mexico
I am one of the many young people who have already been impacted by the climate crisis such as when my hometown was hit by flooding in 2015
I come to this summit knowing that I cannot possibly communicate all of the youth voices that should be here as I am the only one of two who will be addressing you today
As much as it is a great opportunity it is also a great responsibility
I did not want to stand here and read our concerns and demands because if you had been listening you would know what they are
I think it is important for all of us to be on the same page from now and moving forward
The climate crisis is the result of perpetuating the harmful systems of colonialism oppression capitalism and market-oriented greenwash solutions
The 40 leaders who are in this summit are in the majority from the global North which has historically perpetuated these systems
The communities who are the most affected those who have endured displacement because of drought flooding wildfires crop failure and Hhuman rights abus are not fully represented here today
Solutions must be aligned with the fact that climate justice is social justice
We can no longer keep having summits and conversations
We need to change because we already have all of the solutions that we need
So all we have to do is implement them
The fossil fuel industry and the systems that uphold the climate crisis rely on the existence of sacrifice zones
And these sacrifice zones have been intentionally picked to target the global South and black and brown communities in the global North
This is why when it comes to sustainable solutions we youth need to participate in decisionmaking spaces to ensure that the green economy track will not be replicating systems of exploitation and creating new sacrifice because this is already happening in many regions of the world
Green economy with business as usual would severely affect brown and black brown and indigenous communities
You need to accept that the era of fossil fuels is over
We need a just transition to renewables worldwide so that we can stop emitting carbon and focus on drawing down carbon
But most importantly all of these solutions must be implemented with the voices of brown black and indigenous communities as leaders and decisionmakers
We demand that you -- we demand that you stop any new fossil fuel infrastructure and existing fossil fuel including pipelines
We demand comprehensive nonEurocentric climate education including literacy on climate justice environmental ancestral and indigenous wisdom on historical movements
Green careers and sustainable living
We demand that you stop systematically targeting the global South and black on brown indigenous communities through environmental plunder the exploitation of our lands and policies
We demand to get to net zero emissions by 2030 not net zero by 2050 including concrete plans regarding how to get there by annual carbon budgets
We demand that countries increase their commitments to be in line with the Paris agreement target of 15 degrees of warming which is already a compromise for the Arctic the Amazon rainforest and nations and much of the African continent
Here's where we hope that all countries replicate President Biden's commitment to cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030 because we must
We demand that global North countries recognize climate migrants as such
We demand that governments enact policies to protect land defenders and acknowledge our right to peaceful protests and mobilization
-- we are being unrealistic and unreasonable
But who is being unrealistic and unreasonable with unambitious nonbold so-called solutions
You are the ones creating and finding loopholes in your own legislations resolutions policies and agreements
You are the naive ones if you think we can survive this crisis in the current way of living
You are the pessimists if you don't believe we have what it takes to change the world
If you want to know why youth activists are rising up it's because we're striving for joy
Joy for our communities and future generations
The climate crisis is so violent and it has exacerbated so much injustice it is time that you stop thanking us for being activists
It's time for all of us to rise together and recognize that the climate crisis is not only the biggest challenge that humanity has ever faced but it is also the biggest opportunity that we have to change the world
To end please keep in mind that throughout this summit the Fridays for future is holding a summit on April 23rd to say the things we want the whole world to know
My generation is making sure that there are alternative inclusive and radical discourses
In order for this summit to have an impact it is imperative that our demands are recognized and implemented
It is not enough to ask what world we are delivering to future generations but what generations we are delivering to the world
As youth we want to make sure that we can continue to live in harmony with mother Earth until we see the necessary paradigm shift we will keep demanding holistic solutions and most importantly we will be watching and we will be organizing
Thank you for your time
XIYE thank you very much for adding your powerful voice to this summit
People are listening and I thank you
And to everyone who got this summit off to a start this morning thank you very very much
I think we're off to a good start
The conversation continues
We'll see you shortly
Thank you
[ Music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ Music ]  Ladies and gentlemen the president of the United States
Well hello again everyone
Welcome back
As I mentioned this morning meeting the moment on climate change must begin with recognition that every nation has a responsibility and every nation is at risk
Hurricanes and wildfires confine themselves to national borders
Ripple effects that are felt throughout the regions and across the world
Taking on climate change together is more than just the right thing to do
-- to do it
Meeting this challenge is going to require mobilizing financing at an unprecedented scale
The private sector's already recognizing this
They know that climate change is more than a threat
It also presents the largest job creation opportunities in history
Hundreds of billions of dollars are already being invested worldwide every year supporting projects to help build resilient economies with net zero emission goals
But the private sector has more it can do and must do
Let's be clear even then the private sector can't meet these challenges alone
Governments need to step up and they need to lead
We have a role to play in making sure that material climate risks the financial systems are measured disclosed and mitigated
If wall street is pumping billions of dollars into businesses it could be turned upside down when the next storm comes
And we know there will be more storms
Wall street made clear the risk its taking on
Those dollars being invested are often the hard-earned savings of our workers pensions
We can't take steps to protect our workers if we don't step up
We have to be able to move forward from the downside deal then into the upside and strengthen the resilience of our financial system
I've directed my team to develop and approach to do exactly that
And on our nation's -- all of our nations must stand together in shifting policies and public investment as well
To invest and break through technologies to finally end fossil fuel subsidies to help the world's most vulnerable nations and those bearing the least responsibility for the climate crisis cope with the devastating impacts of the climate crisis
To help developing economies leapfrog to the clean technologies of tomorrow to mobilize the trillions of dollars needed to make most of the opportunity to build clean energy job-rich path to meet our goals
To make sure that our climate response is about more than just building and developing new sectors but also about international security regional stability food security and gender and racial equality as well
Our shared goal of mobilizing 100 billion per year in developing countries is critical for achieving that
It's an investment -- specific dividends for all of us
And to help meet that goal the United States will double its 2024 -- by 2024 our annual public climate and financing development to developing countries
Compare that to what we are providing during the second half of the Obama/Biden administration
At the same time we intend to triple our public financing for climate application in developing countries by 2024 recognizing the dividends that pays in reducing cost of disaster and conflicts are avoided
You know our development finance corporation is committing to net zero emissions through its investment portfolio by 2040
-- 33 of all new investments beginning in 2023
The earliest of any country
In addition today we are issuing America's first-ever international climate finance plan
This plan represents our vision for financing the global -- in a coordinated way
It lays out specific steps that federal agencies of the United States will take to increase both the quality and quantity of climate financing
And it will help us spur the private sector to contribute more to climate solutions in developing nations and here at home as well
This moment demands urgency
Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough
We need to ensure that the financing will be there both public and private to meet the moment on climate change and to help us seize the opportunity for good jobs strong economies and a more secure world
I'm confident I'm confident that we're going to get this done together
And I look forward to the progress we are going to make together in today's sessions
So let's move on
Well Mr President thank you very much for your leadership and the sense of urgency which you are calling everybody to account for
And we thank you for hosting this conference in less than a hundred days from entering the oval office
We just heard a very powerful statement from a young activist underscoring the urgency that every leader here faces to meet this crisis
And as you have said Mr President creating a net zero economy and doing it as rapidly as possible is an enormous challenge
It will require mobilizing finance at an absolutely unprecedented level
And it will require governments to help facilitate the net zero transition around the world and to help especially and we've heard it again and again from the leaders this morning the vulnerable countries the people who just don't have the finance or the technology or the ability to do this
Given the magnitude of this challenge however governments loan cannot possibly find all the necessary investment
There's no government in the world that has enough in their fiscal budgets to be able to provide what we need to make this transition
Ultimately how governments international financial institutions is really going to determine the outcome of this challenge
So joining us in this first in this session are four leaders from four different corners of the world
And they will share their experiences in financing climate solutions
And in deploying mitigation and adaptation strategies
So to begin it's my pleasure to turn to president MICHEL of the European council
Thank you
Dear president Joe Biden thank you for convening this important summit
America is at the forefront of -- and to return to the Paris agreement sends a strong global signal
This is good news for the world
We face a civilizational challenge
Human beings have always shown a unique ability to adapt
Adapting from agrarian communities to industrial nations depend on fossil fuels
And today we understand this is not sustainable
And we must once again adapt adapt to -- free economies
This is now the third Industrial Revolution
In December 2019 EU
leaders committed to climate neutrality by 2050
The first major economy to take such a broad decision
And just yesterday we enshrined our ambitious climate goals into European climate law
In a few minutes I'd like to focus on two critical areas green and carbon pricing
First we need to be more determined in the field of climate finance
We decided collectively to mobilize at least $100 billion a year for climate financing
The EU
and our member states remain the largest contributor of public And we urge all developed countries to scale up their contributions
This would send a very strong signal in the run up to cup '26
And this is why our European budget and recovery package will dedicate around 600 billion euros to our green transition
Transition to a low-carbon economy massive investment which far exceeds public investment capacity alone
We need to use our pub lib funding intelligently to create buy-in from the private sector
The dream transition is our prosperity strategy
And 30 of our package will be funded through green bonds
Since finance is double green funds must also be global and we want to cooperate and or orientate the private sector
Green funds was born in Europe and today our currency the euro is by far the leading when it comes to green bonds
We'll soon establish a union green bonds tender but we need to create the right global frame work
Let's try to provide greater incentive for private investors everywhere in the world
In 2019 we set up the platform on sustainable national finance and today the platform represents 55 of global greenhouse gas emissions
We encourage more countries to join
Our European ambition is also reflected from our European financial institutions
As of this year the European investment bank has a lligned a its -- with the growth of the Paris Agreement
It will locate at least 60 of annual financing to green investing by 2025
It will support 1 trillion euro in investment for green projects this decade
And the European Central Bank is also working on the implication of climate change for monetary policy and financial stability
My seven points are a global approach to carbon price is paramount to promoting green investment
If we want to be at peace with nature we need to chase carbon from our business model
This is the only way to change direction
Preserving a global level playing field is essential
We must set the right incentives at the global level because carbon linkage across our economies is instrumental and it's why we're intent to introduce a carbon adjustment level mechanism that's needed to assure a level playing field and it must be -- at we are ready to work bew all of partners on carbon pricing
Dear leaders dear president Joe Biden
A want to be a strong partner and we are ready to join forces with all partners ready to take our collective responsibility for the well being of our people and the well being of our planet
I thank you
Thank you very much president Michel for that important contribution
Now it's my pleasure to introduce prime minster Andrew Holness of Jamaica
President Biden madam vice president special envoy kerry excellences the colleagues happy earth day
The need for meaningful climate action has never been greater
Jamaica is heartened that the United States has rejoined the Paris Agreement an important expression of the global solidarity for climate action
We're also greatly encouraged by the United States' announcement to cut emissions by half
The covid-19 pandemic has created a perfect storm for all island developing states
A lapse of tourism -- revenues rising debt limited access to vaccines and with disasters continuously threatening people -- governments are forced to choose between addressing today's crises and building -- notwithstanding these challenges Jamaica has an announced to limit its national carbon emissions to 60 by 2030
We like all small island developing states and countries remain committed to advancing climate action and we are determined to build forward stronger better and greener
The world committed to $100 billion per year to support climate action in developing countries
It is critical that this commitment not only be honored but that the ambition be increased and major emitters should contribute more to its financing
We welcome President Biden's announcement in this regard
An encourage all governments if you're part of achieving this goal and the private sector must also be engaged
While increasing the quantum of financing is necessary it might not be sufficient to address the needs of small island developing states unless it is accessible and flexible enough to -- for our vulnerabilities
While some progress has been made significant hurdles remain in accessing climate finance and the pace of implementation does not reflect the urgency of the climate crisis
We need to take specific actions to include one the establishment of a global disaster fund that helps states recover and manage disasters
Two the development of innovative risk-informed financing for disasters and climate events
Three the inclusion of vulnerability measure as the prime conscious in access to fin financing
Four the scaling up of debt -- to address climate crisis and the issue affecting
Jamaica we know a great start does not guarantee a win
It requires momentum building
In this case an accessible equitiable climate finance mechanism
We have raised and now call majorkies to raise up and sprint with us to the finish line
We can win this but we must act now
Prime minster Holness
Now I'd like to introduce president Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo
Translator: Your excellenexc the part-time
I am honored to take part in this important virtual summit on the climate initiated by president Joe Biden
This initiative is all the more important because it takes place on this symbolic day of celebration of Earth Day
I would also like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Congo and on behalf of Africa my congratulations to the United States of America and its president for the honorable decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement
Africa is one of the continents that is the most impacted by the negative effects of climate change
Indeed climate change negatively influences social economic development peace and security
Thus jeopardizing the well being of populations and future generations
This is why our country as well as the African continent reiterates their commitment to enter the Paris Agreement and contribute in so doing their fight against global climate change in the context of sustainable development and poverty reduction
For the Democratic Republic of Congo this implementation is by a nationally determined contribution that provides for a 17 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030
This contribution amounts to approximately $21 billion and takes into account both mitigation and adaptation measures
In this regard given the significant forestry potential of the Democratic Republic of Congo we are working to carry out actions that provide for the protection of our forests but also for their efficient management
While seeking to restore our forest cover to 63 by 2030
Among these actions is the ambitious intergenerational reforestation program that aims to replant 1 billion threes by 2033 througho033 throughout ou national territory line with agreement's current revision that will now include the requirement to preserve biodiversity heat Llands as we as other emitting sectors such at energy waste and multimodel trance port we're preserving the goal of decoupling forest use resources from important sector of the economy including energy and agriculture
In addition to these resolutions we have decided to develop our huge renewable energy mix consisteing of -- hydropower solar power as well as the mining of our strategic green metals that will not undoubt BLI contribute to the deforest fact of our economy
As chairperson of the African union I have no doubt that African nations are part of the solution that is required to mitigate the effects of climate change
And as president of the Democratic republic of Congo I am endeavoring to protect the tropical forests in the Congo basin and also to work with our neighbors as well as the international committee to do so
These forests are of critical importance at the global level
Broader than Alaska they cover -- they respond six countries in Africa and thus creating the Congo basin which contains 2 million square kilometers of tropical forest
It also has the largest peat complex in the planet which $30000000 metric ton of carbon three years worth of global emissions
However to be quite Frank these worsts are currently endangered
Illegal use of timber and other raw materials as well as the controlled use of energy is threatening the world's second lung
We can improve the live of people living in these areas by -- and by implementing sustainable energy production as well as better agriculture practices
The Democratic Republic of Congo is striving to do its part but the truth is we can do more with the support of the international community
I know from my discussions with President Biden and Vice President Harris that the United States is willing to invest in this critical issue and I also look forward to increasing our cooperation with all countries international organizations and private entities that wish to make a difference for future gene generations
Existing financial mechanisms are not sufficient to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement neither in term of their mechanisms nor in term of their cost
The current price of forest carbon set at $5 per ton is neither fair nor realistic
Moreover achieving carbon neutrality will not be possible without taking into account the conservation and regeneration of forests
To this end a fair price for forest carbon that incorporates fore gone opportunities should be at least $100 per ton
It is important that the summit accelerates the mobilization of additional financial resources and these should be substantial
This also requires simplifying the procedure accessing financing for the least developed countries the majority of which are in Africa
In this regard I would like to emphasize the importance of the commitment made by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion per year starting in 2020 and to increase this amount by 2025
Finally I would like to express the hope that this summit will pave the way for the 26th conference of the parties to the united nation's frame work on climate change
Thank you for your attention
Thank you very much president Tshisekedi
It's my great pleasure to be able to introduce the prime minster of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern
Thank you President Biden and special envoy Kerry for inviting New Zealand to participate in this summit on climate
Our Pacific neighbors have identified climate change as the single biggest threat to their livelihoods security and well being
Our collective goal here at this summit and beyond has to be effective global action on climate change
That means our collective commitments in 2021 will need to be enough to limit global warming to 15 degrees above preindustrial temperatures
New Zealand has hit the 15 degree limit at the heart of our domestic climate change legislation our zero carbon act
We've also committed to a climate target and we're under way to -- to ensure we are doing our part
Because we must
Our collective transition to low carbon economies means that all aspects of our economic activity is going to need to be working towards limiting global warming to 15 degrees
Finance -- both or financial systems and financial flows to assist developing countries is at the heart of that transition
And that's why we call on others to follow what here in New Zealand we have done by doing the following four things
One price carbon
Two make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory
Three end fossil fuel subsidies and
And four finance adaptation
New Zealand has been pricing carbon since 2008 and in a world first will begin pricing agricultural emissions from If you price carbon emitters follow by innovating
On finance in 2020 New Zealand was the first country to announce mandatory climate related financial disclosures
What gets reported gets managed
It's one thing for investors to have a climate lens in their investment but whens the economy wide that changes the way all financial flows and risks are managed
On fossil fuels global agreement on the need for fossil fuel subsidy reform is long overdue
Fossil fuel subsidies endue any advances we make on pricing carbon
We cannot take money from those pricing carbon and give them money back in subsidies
Join us in supporting a WTO administerial statement in November
Finally developing countries particularly those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have a genuine need for easily accessible finance to support their climate change action both in adaptation and mitigation
This is even more important as economies recover from covid-19
While support for adaptation has been increasing finance for adaptation remains low
We must do better to support countries for the impact of climate change
The numbers we are discussing are beyond astronomical
Globally fossil fuel subsidies total around $500 billion US a year
This is five times our annual climb goal of $500 billion US a year
Imagine what millions could do to help us reach our collective goal to limit global warming to 15 degrees above preindustrial levels
It is time to stop imagining and do what is needed
[ Speaking foreign language ]  Thank you very much prime minster Ardern for that powerful intervention
I want to thank the president
I know the president has to step out but I want to thank him for being here for these important heads of state comments on the finance
Mr President we very much appreciate you being here
Thank you John
We wouldn't be here responsing this without you
Thank you
Thank you
Well you called the summit
So I have the great pleasure now of introducing my friend Janet yYellen who's our terrifc secretary of treasury
She's been an extraordinary partner and a stalwart champion on climate issues since her day at the federal reserve
She has long recognized the threat the climate crisis poses to the financial marketplace the United States and around the world
And now as secretary of treasury she is continuing to use every lever at her disposal to tackle the climate crisis
Over to you Madam secretary
Over to you
Thank you
I'm honored to join you today
The global community has only a short time to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change
We need a sprinting start now if we wish to achieve our goal of net net zero emissions by mid century
President Biden we committed the unite to do its part to tackle this crisis and Marshall the full capacity of the US government
As treasury secretary I understand finance public and private is crucial to enable countries to accelerate their progress toward a net zero emissions future and cope with a climate that is already changing
But this will require economic and political choices
Governments and business leaders around the world are pondering these choices
Let me mention two questions that keep me up at night
First how can nations best reduce emissions while supporting economic development and responding to other major challenges such as covid-19
This is especially challenging for low-income countries that have few available resources and pressing development needs
And second how should governments target public sector climate finance to mobilize the greatest private sector inve investments
Past efforts to support private investment have not achieved anywhere knnear the scale neede to green the global economy
I can tell you that the United States Treasury will focus the full range of our tools and expertise -- concrete and innovative answers to these questions
Multilateral institutions are invaluable partners in the pursuit of sustainable inclusive and resilient development
For these reasons in our 2022 budget we have requested $12 billion for the green climate fund
$485 million to support the multilateral climate initiatives
And increase support for the multilateral development banks
As you will hear from our panel while we're making progress there's a need for redoubled efforts to boost the flow of capital and foster the growing market demand for climate al aligned investments
This effort will involve engagement on many fronts
US treasury is working to facilitate investments in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect against the impacts of a changing environment
We do that in part by providing technical assistance to foreign counterparts that help attract private sector investment in clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects
We're also working with the G-20 and KOE cochairing a sustainable work group that will happy finance a sustainable road map and improve the information that private investors have to make investment decisions aligned with a more healthy and prosperous future
In the end though we know we will only achieve our goal of curtailing climate change through collective action
Today we as a global community need to be ambitious -- set goals work together and sprint toward a cleaner safer better future
We look forward to meeting this challenge together
Thank you very much Madam secretary
We really appreciate that input
We're all looking forward to hearing from the panel that we have now
Because the criticality of the finance structure to the solution of the climate can't be emphasized enough
The UN finance report is a gap report that tell us we have a gap in financing of climate related efforts of about $1 trillion to $2 trillion per year for the next 30 years
As I said earlier with President Biden here there is no way that any one government anywhere or even a group of governments are going to put that kind of funding to task
So we've gathered leaders today from top public international financial institutions and we have top executives from some of the largest private managers of capital
In order to address the climate crisis we understand that we have to increase our ambition
We've increased our expectations
But the question before every leader here today is how can the combined world of public and private finance meet this challenge
Disclosure is one thing that is obviously going to drive capital in the direction we want but how can public and private finance work together to accelerate this move towards a net-zero economy where the technologies are being deployed that need to be deployed and where jobs are being added at a very rapid rate
So the question before the panel today is what can the world of finance do in this decade now immediately
What is the most consequential step that can be taken in the race to stop the planet from reaching above 15 degrees
It's going to take unprecedented cooperation but what does that cooperation look like
We're going to look for those answers
I want to introduce first my friend Kristalina Georgieva the managing director of the international monetary fund
Kristalina
There you are
Thank you
The IMF obviously plays a key role through its surveillance and policy dialogues with the world financial authorities and from your perspective -- and you have been at this for quite a period of time -- what economic and financial policies are most likely in your judgment to axel late the transition to zero net carbon and how do you see the IMF playing a key role in that
Thank you very much special envoy Kerry
I want to recognize President Biden Secretary Yellen yourself for giving this gift to mother nature in our future with this summit today
At the IMF we look at climate change as central in our work on macroeconomic growth and financial stability growth and employment
It presents huge risks to the functioning of our economy but it also offers through action incredible opportunities for transformative investments and green jobs
So let me focus on your question by highlighting three areas where right policies would make a significant difference
First I want to echo prime minster Ardern
A robust price on carbon together with phasing out subsidies phases out a critical market signal to producers and consumers in all sectors of the economy
It has proven to advance investments in renewable energy electric energy reforestation with positive impact on growth and jobs while reducing carbon emissions
And carbon revenues can also help secure a just transition compensating households for price increases and helping businesses and workers move from high to low carbon intensity activities
Our analysis shows that without it we will not reach our climate stabilization goals
It also shows that a mix of steadily rising carbon prices with guidance and green infrastructure investments could increase global GDP by more than 07 per year over the next 15 years and create millions as President Biden says good-paying new jobs
Carbon pricing is gaining momentum
Many businesses now use shadow carbon price
Over 60 pricing schemes have been implemented but we are not near where we should be
The average global price is currently $210
It needs to rise to $75 a ton by 2030 to curb emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement
This is what we want to propose -- because of the urgency to act we need an international carbon price floor among large emitters such as the G-20
Focus on a minimum carbon price among a small group of large emitters could facilitate an agreement covering up to 80 of global emissions
This price floor has to be pragmatic and equitable with different countries at different levels of economic development
And it can be implemented through different means -- carbon taxes trading systems or measures that lack policy preferences
And crucially if we are to have a price floor we may avoid the less efficient and potentially contagious carbon adjustments
If some countries move ahead with robust pricing while others do not
Second green tax onmy standardized reporting of climate related financial risks
Both are necessary to unlock trillio trillions of dollars in finance private finance
When we look at investors more than half cite the availability of data as the biggest barrier toing
This is why we're working with members and partner on data quality and disclosure as well as on financial sector stress testing for climate related risks
Third financial support to developing countries
They offer many of the lowest cost opportunities so it is in even's interest to full fell the commitment to $100 billion a year and we have to innovate including as we now work with the World Bank a potential for climate swaps
Combined with the transfer and climate support it would make it possible to decouple growth and carbon emissions
Let me finish
We will do our part Special Envoy Kerry we'll -- and will actively promote low carbon climate resiliency growth paths that we need
Thank you
Thank you very much
We really appreciate that madam director
Kristalina those are three powerful and important contributions and if we have time we may come back and inquire further
I want to turn to Yannick Glemarec now
He's the executive director as everybody knows of the Green Climate Fund
The GCF has a large portfolio of climate projects around the world
How is the fund going to enable countries to join and push the boundaries of innovation and to blunt the impacts of climate crisis
Thank you very much Special Envoy John Kerry to invite the green climate fund to participate in this summit
We feel honored to be part of it
Innovation in new technologies business model and financing instruments is imperative to achieve to goals of the Paris Agreement
GCF was established to foster paradigm shift in a fight against climate change
If I may quote your words at a recent event John kerry GCF's ideas is to put existing to work and scale up new IDs
We work with over 200 national and international partners including commercial and -- banks united nation agencies and private equity funds
This enables us to foster unprecedented coalitions to finance frontiers in climate investment
We use a range of financing instruments to meet the need of developing countries and investors
Grant debt guarantees and equity
This flexibility lets us find a new financial structure to create new markets for new climate solution
We -- scaleabilities in four ways
First we have a dedicated grant funding readiness program to support developing countries' effort to incubate novel ideas
Second we pilot innovative ideas to establish a proof of concept
For example we are providing risk capital to SMEs that are developing offgrid and climate resilient architecture for communities in east Africa
Risk capital is extremely scarce in developing countries
Yet it is a precondition for no inno innovation
Third often together with partners like the World Bank and the African development bank here today we -- finance by serving as an early investor to establish a report for new climate solution
As an illustration we are anchor investor to mobilize institutional investors for what will be the world's largest Sea water solar power plant in Chile
Finally domestic and entrepreneurs to illustrate the widespread -- of commercially attractive innovation
Plain vanilla projects are a luxury we cannot afford
We must make every dollar count in the fight against climate change
Thank you very much
You put your finger on one of the most vexing components of this which everybody should perhaps think about and that's concessional concessionary money the derisking taking the risk away is going to be absolutely essential and I think it's something we're all going to need to work on
I thank you
My next question's for David m Malpass president of the world bank group
The world bank group is the largest funder of multi multilateral -- in developing countries
Your 2021 action plan is going to be published in the coming weeks
How will the world bank group contribute to raising ambition on climate through this new plan
Thank you secretary Kerry and everyone it's a pleasure to be with you
We published a summary of our action plan today
The core of the plan is to spend more -- in fact record amounts -- in the ways that get the most results
That means helping the biggest emitters flatten the greenhouse gas emissions curve and accelerate the down trend and it also means record setting adaptation
That's at least 50 of our climate finance to help countries prepare for and adapt to climate change
As background world bank group has reach its highest ever levels of climate finance in the past two years
Our plan commits to big increases in spending focused on results
Plus active private sector mobilization through IFC and m MIGA。 MIGA
And importantly we're allowing and aligning our financing with the parrot Agreement
The key to make this work is integrate climate and development
We need to identify the biggest mitigation and adaptation opportunities and use those to drive or financing
This is a path I hope others will follow
To spend more but do it in ways that will achieve the most useful results
For example in a given country will it be more effective to invest in green agriculture or low-carbon energy or drainage systems that can save lives in a hurricane
We're adding diagnosistics that will help with these
We're working with countries to reduce subsidies right-hand siding they're expensive and distorted
Some countries will want to implement taxes on carbon and might reduce taxes elsewhere
Nature-based solutions and renewable energy solutions each have a key role
An important element of our plan so to support the transition from coal to an affordable and sustainable energy and our plan also includes diagnostics to help achieve the best results from adaptation
What are the best opportunities to save lives and livelihoods
And this type of prioritization in planning is critical I think to achieve the most impact and results from climate finance
We're actively engaged with developing countries on their NDCs and long-term strategies and we'll be introducing new in-depth country climate and development reports
So all in all our plan is ambitious
We're integrating climate and development to engage the full resources of the World Bank Group
We're work on -- I'm glad you mentioned concessionary resources
We're working on a strong development for the poorest countries
Climate action will be a core theme of that
Also middle income countries will need additional support
Green bonds blue bonds fi financial innovation -- they call play a key role and the world bank group provides a platform for this type of leveraging of donor resources
We can combine financing with deep country-based climate and development know-how and that all reduces the fragmentation that is occurring in climate and development
So I have other comments I would love to make but above all we recognize the severity and the inequality of the current environment
People are facing challenges everywhere
There are tough issues that I haven't been able to name for us
The challenges are different country by country and to be valid we have to take into account the full life cycle costs and benefits of various climate policy choices
So what we know is that poverty inequality and climate change are defining our time and increasingly they go hand in hand
Our goal is to provide support and take prompt action in ways that create the most positive impact toward green resilient and inclusive -- thank you
No thank you David
I think that's a comprehensive answer and much appreciated
I think when you listen to the young woman who spoke earlier Xiye and the challenge and impatience of coming generations but you also compare that to the magnitude of the job we have to do
I mean we are way behind
Everybody understands we're way behind
I think the effort to bring up to scale even more is our great challenge and I think we all need to work together
I wish we had more time in the context of this panel but we need to do that
So I thank you for opening up that conversation
I want to turn to Akinwumi Adesina the president of the African Development Bank
Thank you
Thank you very much
Let me just -- if I can frame a question to you
Sorry Akinwumi
The African bank is the only multilateral development bank now to focus over one half of your financing on projects with adaptation and resilience objectives
Not most people are doing that
How is the bank doing this
And what have we learned you learned about how to do adaptation effectively that we can share with others
Thank you very much secretary
I was just following the prime minster of Jamaica to say sprint
Just getting off the blocks
I want to thank first for inviting secretary Kerry very much for inviting me to the summit
For all of us President Biden's election has Ginngiven us renew hope
Secretary Kerry you're also a friend to the global climate
A special envoy is a strong signal
And also a point in secretary Yellen in treasury
In my view it completes the action triangle of leadership passion and finance that's critically needed for global action on climate change
To be sure climate change is a threat to Africa
The continent loses 17 to $50 billion a year on climate change and this will rise to $50 billion a year to 2040 according to the IMF
Africa the least emitter suffering the worst of the impacts of climate change including droughts floods and L locust and pest invasions
Africa is at ground zero
We must therefore give Africa a lift to get a chance of adapting at what it did not cause
At the Africa Development Bank we are leading this charge for Africa
We have committed funds
Our share of financing devoted to climate rose just a mere 9 in 2016 to 35 in 2019 will reach 40 in 2021 this year
We are also setting the pace -- as you said secretary Kerry we are the only development bank to meet and exceed the 50 parity for climate and resilience William a donate 50 in 2018 and last year we increased that to a record 63
We are climate-proofing Africa
The bank started 40 million farmers with climate start agriculture practices
We're also splitting up Africa's united transition to renewable energy
We helped support the largest wind power plant in Africa in Kenya
And now we have a $20 billion investment that will provide opportunities to turn the Sahara into the world's largest solar zone and provide electricity to 250 million people
We are securing the future
We have pledged $26 million to pledge to build the wall to protect against -- we are employing the Africa disaster risk facility to help could you repeats to pay for insurance premiums against catastrophic climate events
We are also building strategic partnerships and you are a key part of that secretary Kerry with the center for adaptation and we have created a largely African adaptation program
Our goal so to mobilize $25 million for the program exclusively for scaling up on adaptation
African heads of state global leader includiing Gutierrez secretary Yellen joined
Africa secretary Kerry is determining to speed up green growth
What is needed now is green painer to back the green growth
It's time countries make their promise for developing countries
Together we must secure the future and make hope come alive for the present
The African adaptation program is Africa's plan
Your excellency President Biden's support -- to rise from ground zero on its way to net zero
Together we adapt
Together we prosper
Thank you very much Mr Secretary
Well thank you very much Akinwumi
That's a tremendous effort
I wish we had more time because there's so much to dive into but we will work with you in this effort going forward
It's my pleasure now to turn to Brian Moynihan the chairman and CEO of the Bank of America chair of the international business counsel and cochair of the sustainable markets initiative
Brian if I can ask you bank of America committed yesterday to joining the net zero banking alliance and the Glasgow agreement
Can you explain what this means for bank of America's -- to transition $100 million over ten years
And I think -- why don't I just leave it there
Thank you special envoy Kerry and I thank President Biden for convening this session
We joined Glasgow -- for zero because it -- not only our company be companies across all sectors
It demonstrates the commitment we have to meet -- early on in this session
We're confident we can deliver on bank of America's commitment to deliver $1 trillion over the next decade because our customer from all sectors are making commitments
These commitments make a fundamental drive in demand
The private sector therefore is key to bringing about the capital innovation to drive a just transition
And we as a bank have to help our clients make that transition
Now as you mentioned John I personally worked with many of my colleagues across industries as they make net zero or similar commitments
I cochair with the prince of Wales
This was a volunteer army ■ working to accelerate their efforts
As el managers owners agriculture companies companies from all sectors of the economy are committed to working to accelerate the commitments they made to net zero
The other example similar to this is the world economic forum alliance for CEO leaders
100 companies driving towards net zero working together to see how they can accelerate the pace
Another piece we worked on is standardized metrics to verify the world economic forum's international business counsel
The big four accounting firms helped us unKo these metrics
They disclose emissions across all scopes by all companies
The metrics show stake holholde what a company's plan is
Many more are joining
These metrics provide a road map for how a company can disclose in a straights forward understandable way their path forward and we believe they should be the basis for the broader sector
In deploying $100 trillion at bank of America that's created by the demand our customers are making
To use a phrase your colleagues have used it takes a whole of the bank approach to make this happen
First in our op weighs how we use energy
Second we have to work with small and medium sized companies to reset their operations in the transition for them
They not only need our money they need our expertise as they don't have large staffs the big Canes have
Third is our markets activity
Primarily raising capital for the larger companies to fund their operational restructuring
We're already one of the largest financers in that area and did $100 billion alone across the SDG
We also will raise equity for innovative new companies to fund their technologies and growth
And we'll also raise money in finance structures that Mr Malpass mentioned deliver public moneys from the MDIs that spoke today especially to hope those developing countries another area we have to work on is our research area
Our research shows companies focused on -- are better investments
This provide a carrot to companies
Then we bring to the table our investment platform
Bringing cash from individual investors whose demand for USG funds and similar investments is growing because they simply care
Even in our commitments on racial and social justice in the United States at $125 billion or commitmented to low and moderate income housing all are the same with the transition pathways
We're committed to net zero and the good news is many of our private sector colleagues with also committed
We believe the private sector colleagues are significantly important and the critical path forward for net zero for the world
We're there to help those customers make that transition and provide financing lie a bank should
We deliver nor society and shareholders
We look forward to helping you in your endeavors here
Thank you very much Brian
That's a pretty comprehensive undertaking and I might just comment that yesterday you are one of six banks that announced ann an ing a RA GAT amount of money that will be allocated over the next six years which is an incredible start to provide the type of finance we need
I want to turn now to Jane Fraser who is the CEO of CITIgroup。 CITIgroup
She's been thrown in because she's only been the chair the CEO -- she's been there a long time but -- you already announced that Citi -- lending business by 2050 and you're setting 2030 goals
You also yesterday announced you're joining the net zero banking alliance which is a pretty fast start
With respect to the climate crisis what is it that you're now setting out as the knew CEO
How do you hope to change or advance Citi's relationship to climate constituent or climate crisis
First let me thank secretary Kerry for your leadership on climate and your invitation to the summit
I may have been CEO for only a short time but Citi has been helping lead or industry's drive to sustainable around the world for many years we helped create the equator principles back in 2003 and the green bond principles back in 2014 both of which have been establishing important industry standards
And in 2018 Citi became the first bank to report on our efforts to implement the task force on financial disclosures frame work which provides transparency about the impact climate change has from a risk management perspective
So I'm very happy to see the cross section of institutions participating today because solving climate change is really going to require the ultimate public/private partnership
And agreeing on common metrics and common standards is going to be fundamental
At Citi our goals for 2030 are ground on three principles and priorities first is financing climate solutions
The second is measuring the reduction of climate risk and impact of our own clients in the portfolio
And the third is continuing to minimize our own company's direct impacts on the planet
We recently committed to $500 billion in environmental projects and activities by 2030 and this is a tenfold increase over our very first commitment way back in 2007
And combined with our plans to finance $500 billion by 2030 in areas such as health care and affordable housing like bank of America we've committed a total of $1 trillion to advance the UN sustainable development goals
And we're proud to do this
Now some thing that confronts climate change and creating jobs and economic inclusion are in conflict but we believe we're only going to be successful in tackling our global challenges if these three agendas are working together
Sew solving climate change must be a driver of jobs and of economic prosperity
Now in what is our biggest challenge yet as a firm we're targeting net zero emissions by the year 2050 and underscoring its importance I announced this commitment on my very first day as CEO
And this is a bold goal for a global bank like ours because it means not only addressing the emissions from our own operations which we intend to have done by 2030 but also those emissions produced by our client portfolio
And yesterday as you said we're very proud to help launch the net banking zero alliance with Brian and others to establish a common industry frame work for net zero
But we know that to truly fight climate change our clients which include many of the biggest world multinationals as well as investors and countries like the ones we've heard from today will also need to transition to net zero and we will join them on this journey
Net zero's very easy to say but it's going to be hard to do and make no mistake about this -- this is going to be really hard
We think it's going to require three critical things -- putting hard numbers to this
Because when we look across our client portfolio particularly in carbon intensive sectors measuring our finance emissions is rather a task
Second having tough conversations with our clients
Do they have a net zero plan themselves
And how can we partner with them on the execution of this critical transition
And in a client isn't interest in the decarbonization well what does that mean for our long-term relationship
And the third element is looking outside the company
We've all got to accelerate technology development whether it's through renewables or carbon capture and we have to get behind supporting the public policy that is really going to be essential to making this all happen
So yes we're acting with urgency
We're excited about this road ahead
But I do want to underscore it's not going to be easy and we're going to need all the pragmatism and partnership we can muster together
I can assure you whether it's the drive to net zero or the other important parts of our ESG agenda including closing the gender pay gap and promoting racial equity we're going to back up our commitments with real action and measurable results because that's what matters
Our clients and shareholders and people they're expecting nothing less
So thank you for having me today
Thank you for coming
Appreciate your presentation
And congratulations on getting off to such a great quick start
You said twice getting to net zero is going to be hard really hard
And I just remind everybody that that will depend on whether or not we have some breakthrough technologies and breakthrough innovations
But even if we get to net zero we still have to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere so this is a bigger challenge than a lot of people have sort of really grabbed on to yet
And again we can't do it without your engagement and support
So we thank youer for that
I want to turn now if I may to ask a question of Oliver bate the CEO of allianz
You represent one of the biggest insurance companies in the world and one committed to net zero
I remember being at a conference with you yearsing into you made huge commitments
Given your long experience in climate help us understand what do you think the business community needs to do just bluntly in order to accelerate the amount of capital that's flowing into net zero transition
How are we going to get there
Thank you Special Envoy and it's a great pleasure to be with you all and being the European today in your conference as an expert
We started actually with the net zero in September 2019 we were only about 13 companies
Marcie will talk about that convened by the UN and particularly secretary JENL Gutierrez who I would like to applause for his initiative
At the time it was a coalition of the willing
It was people that had the dedication wanted to put their personal energy and their companies behind that
So the answer is we need to move from something that is voluntary and a coalition of the willing to make it mandatory in the financial sector to drive to net zero
The German insurance industry that is committing to 100 so we need to move from a few banks to a few managers and asset owners
We have today heard more than 70 of global GDP committing to net zero
Unless there's a lot of countries that have large wealth funds that have not yet committed to zero and we should ask ourselves why that is
So we need to move from an idea and an aspiration to action
Otherwise it will remain as Thomas Edison says an illusion
And our children will not be happy
So reporting making sure we have transition finance both into green energy but out of brown energy
But we need to have a deadline
A lot of these things have deadlines to '50 that are too far out
In the net zero owner asset lines every member has to deliver concrete target and actions and achieve results by 2025 and that is around the corner
That is what we really need to com com do
We need a pathway
Last but not least as a quote to one of my kids they said dad put a headline behind these things and reinterpret it
It means get in line or fold it
So we make sure people cannot sneak out and deliver
Thank you Oliver
I'm with your kids
Thank you for your contribution
Finally the last panelist is Marcie Frost the CEO ofcalpers
I'd like to ask you what are the barriers to mobilizing the money that is needed for climate solutions and what governments can do about it together in your own investments
And what is the experience of Calpers say to you
Thank you special envoy Kerry as well as on behalf of Calpers we appreciate and are honored to be a part of this summit
As the largest public defined benefit system in the United States Calpers manages approximately $450 billion on behalf of 2 million members
Our ability to pay benefits decades into the future means we take a long-term view in assessing whether the companies in our portfolio manage the risks successfully
We've managed risk that our companies face and engage directly with the -- efforts to mitigate those risks
We also work on global initiatives to help develop more effective reporting frame works
Calpers is a cofounder of climate action 100 plus
We ensure the world's largest corporate greenhouse emitters take necessary action on climate change
A newly released benchmark from this group indicates the seriousness around this topic and how serious investors like Calpers are toward in target
We believe it's also vital that federal regulators do their part and monitor risks to the financial system and provide clear guidance to financial institutions who are really addressing these risks on a daily basis
If federal regulators are not atte attentive with their counterparts to monitor risks -- we believe coordination is necessary to protect markets from disruptions
Our capital markets also need to adequately mitigate these risks
So in our view government should take three immediate steps
The first one is in support of Secretary Yellen that rewire mandatory risk reporting
We welcome reporting standards in this area
Sustainable data disclosure should be fully integrated with and held to the same standards as financial data disclosures whether that's a timely release of this data how comprehensive that data is the reliability of that data and the ability to audit it
Investment data would be a game changer and could lead to an inflection point
We also believe removal of all fossil fuel subsidies to that industry should be eliminated
We also believe as many stated prior to me that instituting carbon pricing is essential to the markets to met gate ongoing and future risk
Without these policy measures investors like Calpers as one large institutional investor we do not have the data for climate intelligence capital -- and subsidy stewardship
The commodity future's trading report on climate change as a financial risk backs all three of these points and Calpers was a member of that committee
Calpers will continue to address climate risk so they can be accounted for comprehensively in your portfolio and we look forward to working with regulators to advance initiatives to protect our markets from climate risk
With that I'd like to thank you again for allowing Calpers for participating in the summit
Thank you Marcie
Thank you
Unfortunately because of time we have to move to our next few speakers but I want to say to everybody on the panel and everybody listening that I think each of the participants representing a different approach and different kinds of institutions in the aggregate underscore the degree to which this market is changing
Those moving the address the crisis are not saying there's a sacrifice to be made
In fact they're saying it's the opposite
There's an enormous opportunity
The largest market the world has ever known is waiting for everybody and growing by the day right now
And I don't think these institutions would be talking about investing if it weren't true that they're able to produce a return on that investment for the investors
So this market is going to happen
The challenge is whether or not it happens fast enough
And already we're seeing exponential movement in technologies the capacities but we're going to need all of you even more because we obviously are behind and we have to accelerate and bring a lo t f things to scale that just aren't there yet
It's known to do this about half of the emissions we have to reduce are going to be reduced by technologies that are not yet at scale in the market
So you know we're at 45 billion to 5 billion energy user market today
We're going up to 9 billion in the next 30 years
That's the largest market in the world some thank you for being here and sharing your thoughts and I'm sure we're going to be working together and sharing a lot more going forward
It's my privilege to turn to two leaders who together are helping to shepherd this process the international climate negotiations to ensure that we can deliver on the promise of the Paris Agreement with the ambitious action that is needed in order to achieve 15 degree limit in the warming
So I want to introduce minister Carolina Schmidt who led Chile's presidency at the 2019 UN
Climate Conference and who in particular underscored the important links between the ocean -- Chile is an ocean country and one that's very dedicated to dealing with ocean issues
And theshe was a leader in help to draw the links between the ocean and climate crisis
Chile's ambitious climate plan is an example of how oceans play an an integral role in the climate crisis
After her we'll hear from Alok Sharma who's preparing if a whole nobody -- preparing for cop 26
He's managed this work with relentless determination
We're grateful for his leadership and are lacking forward to working closely with the United Kingdom on COP 26
Carlina if you would lead off and then we'll go the Alok and then we'll close out this session
Thank you
Thank you John
Distinguished delegates my warm greetings to you all from Chile
And a special thanks to our host the United States
Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity this century and this year 2021 with the United States fully back in the Paris Agreement it's the year the multilateral process must show it's up to the challenge to bring the agreement into full operation
2025 in Madrid
We're taking steps towards this
For the first time a mandate to address oceans was established an important step for the integration of the CLIERMT and -- agendas highlighting a importance of the protecting oceans
-- knowledge on loss and damage with the Santiago network William adopted a gender action plan for climate action with justice
With action on adaptation as relevant and urgent as mitigation holding the first COP
and develop key progress bringing us closer to an agreement on a global market mechanism on article 6
But one of the most fundamental of COP 25 was the alliance for carbon neutrality bringing together for the first time state and nonstate actors committed with concrete plans to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest
Following the science and realizing that countries alone cannot face this challenge
We need the commitments and plans for transformation through innovation technology and resources of the private sector
COP 25 presidency and 26 of UK are working close together to increase the climate ambitious using all tools available to work with everybody even though these difficult times of the pandemic
Working together with the UK and chance of COP 25 and 26 the high ambitious alliance has become the greatest committed
Over 3000 have counting for over 75 of$75 of global GDP o alliance that include not only the world's biggest companies and now as well with the Glasgow alliance also more than 160 of the biggest banks investors and insurers representing more than $70 trillion globally
The momentum is with us
Climate leaders around the world recognize that carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest is not only a -- development b
The world is watching us and we accept nothing less than a complete and ambitious outcome at COP 26 that must consider mitigation adaptation and finance as equally urgent
On the road to GLOZlasgow we ur all countries and nonstate organizations to join us for the people for the planet and for a prosperous future for the world
Thank you
Thank you for your forceful leadership
We're going to need you more than ever
Over to you Alok
Thanks for joining us
Thank you John and thank you for your kind destruction
Your excellencies ladies and gentleman friends
Before a baby born today has even finished primary education the future will be set
We all know that the next decade will be make or break for planet earth and the warning lights are flashing bright red
And that is why the decisions that world leaders are taking today and indeed on the road to COP 26 are going to be absolutely critical
I want to thank President Biden for bringing us together and for the US's own national contribution
I want to thank everyone who's made announcements and made us closer to our clean green future to creating the jobs and prosperity without harming the planet
And with today's announcements from the US from Canada from Japan every G-7 country now has an NDC that puts them on a path to net zero by 2050
This is a significant step towards keeping 15 degrees within reach from a group of countries who have a responsibility to lead
As you have heard net zero commitments now cover 70 of the global economy and this is real progress
But we have much further to go because as I said at the climate ambition summit in December the key issue S have we collectively done enough to limit warming to 15 degrees to protects you'res from climate change and making the Paris Agreement a reality
Friends the answer to that question is still no
Not yet
Between now and COP 26 there will be more opportunity countries to raise their ambition so so we must
Because if we are serious about 15 degrees we must be serious about NDC and must be serious about acting now and serious about supporting developing countries
The next IPCC report will show us again the urgency of our situation and the world is looking expectantly to its leaders to respond and we must prove we are up to the challenge
And we must make COP 26 the turning point where we get back on track and make the goals of the Paris Agreement
That means putting our goals on a path to net zero and taking immediate action to immediate those targets by for example phasing out coal
So I welcome South Korea's commitment to end overseas coal financing
Second we must boost adaptation
Third we need finance as we've heard about in this session
And we must all see ourselves as champions for countries whose calls we have heard loud and clear today
Climate change we all know does not respect borders and tackling it is absolutely a global effort
So developed countries must mobilize that promised $100 billion a year and I very much welcome the US return to the fold following today's initial finance Kcommitment an we will continue to work with all donors to increase our collective goal
Finally we must work together to deliver a low-carbon world and make the negotiations in Glasgow a success
Friends today we have made progress on our goals but we need a further step change
We need world leaders to mount a global response that matches the scale and the urgency of the crisis we face
This is the defining issue of our political age
The one against which future generations will judge us above all others
But I do believe that we can and we must rise to the occasion
Thank you
Alok thank you for those very important words
President Biden is hosting this summit because he agrees with what you just said -- we're not there yet
The theme of this summit is raising ambitious
A bunch of countries raised ambition today including the United States
The United States and certain countries are hitting targets now that do get them on track to hold on to the 15 degrees
And prime minster modi with his renewable if it gets deployed keeps India on this track
So there's a beginning of the level of commitment necessary but as Alok just underscored we know currently also we're not where we need to be and the science is going to document that increasingly over the course of the next months
So this is the beginning of building blocks heading towards Glasgow
And Glasgow will be what many of us think is the last best hope to be able to get the world on track to did what we need to do
There's a lot of work to be done
I thank you Alok and thank you Carolina and I look forward to working with both of you in the coming months
When we return we'll have a message from a very special guest and then we will go into our breakout session on climate change at all levels as well as a separate breakout on adaptation and resilience
Those are the first two breakout sessions and we look forward to seeing through
Thank you all very much
We take a short break and come back to go into that session
It's not that long a break
Thank you
Recent disrecoveries made by scientists are sewerly the greatest importance for all of us
The insights are deeply trowelling
Nonetheless they also give us hope because they show us how we can fix things
He has focused on what keeps our planet stable
What he and his colleagues around the world have discovered is perhaps the most important scientific insight of our times
This ice core data I think is the most important graph we have today
The graph is a revelation
It shows global temperature barrier over the past 100000 years since the modern humans
We are jumping 10 degrees Celsius in a decade
We had to put it simple a rough time
What's critical is the temperature stabilized just 10000 years ago
Geologyists have given this period of stability its own special name
It's called the Holocene
It's remarkable
It's a warm period where the global planet's temperature --  The stable temperatures gave us a stable planet
Sea levels stabilized
For the first time we had predictable seasons and reliable weather
This stability was fundamental
For the first time civilization was possible and humanity wasted no time in taking advantage
The Holocene is the only state of the planet we know for certain is the only state that can support
But we just left it behind
The exponential rise of human pressures on earth have created our own geological epoch
We are now in the anthrocene
It's a mind boggling situation
For the first time we have to consider the risk of destabilize
There's the danger we may have crossed the a boundary
The most alarming is change in the planet's ice
Having permanent ice in the arctic and Antarctica
A permanent wide surface like what we can see around us here is reflecting back 90 95 of incoming heat from the sun
When these ice sheets start melting you can come to a point where the ice sheets tip over from being self-cooling to becoming self-warming and that is the most dramatic tipping point in the earth's system
A tipping point is a point beyond which a change becomes irrev irrev irreversible
In the current climate greenland is already beyond its threshold where it's now losing 10000 cubic meters of ice per second
That's the average loss rate
Now that loss rate will only continue as the climate heats up
So is Greenland lost
Evidently it is
The drama here is that one characteristic of tipping points is that once you've pressed the on button you cannot stop it
It takes over
It's too late
It's not like you can say oops now I realized I didn't want to melt the Greenland ice sheet
It's too late
The important point to make is everything in the earth's system is connected
If one part of the climate system crosses its tipping point then that might make it more likely for other parts of the system to also cross their critical threshold so you can think of this in terms of dominos
If you tip one of them over then this might lead to cascading effect
When we cross tipping point we unleash irreversible changes
That means the planet will go to one of our best friends where it dampens and reducing the stress sucking up carbon dioxide take upping heat and absorbing impacts and tipping to a point where it could reinforce warming and become a foe
In 1998 we passed 350 parts per million of carbon die sock side in the earth's atmosphere
This is where we crossed the boundary
Ever since then -- at risk of triggering runaway warming
Right now we have concentrations of carbon dioxide of roughly 450 parts per million
We're in the middle of the zone in term of rising frequency of droughts and heat waves and floods and accelerated melting of ice and thawing after permafrost
The uncertainty range lies between 350 PPM up to 450 PPM which is when you exit the danger zone and go into high risk zone
If we enter the high risk zone tipping points become highly likely if not inevitable and this is a conservative estimate given that the signs of tipping points are all around us now
We are fast approaching a major tipping point in one of the planet as largest remaining wildernesses
The Amazon
Large parts of the rain forest are drying out
As the forest is reduced and fragmented its ability to recycle water and generate rain into the dry season is diminished
If the dry season becomes longer than four months the jungle trees dry and becomes the Sahara and released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
It could produce 200 billion tons over the next 30 years
That's equivalent all carbon emitted worldwide for the past five years
We are very very close to the tipping point
Are we concerned about fighting the climate crisis
Are we concerned about keeping the carbon in the forests
Or I don't care
Now that Yohann and his colleagues have turned on the headlights we can clearly see the boundaries
We can see the path back to a safe space to a more resilient future
It is achievable
An immediate priority is to reduce carbon emissions to zero and stabilize global temperature as low as we possibly can
Since the beginning of the industrial revolution we have emitted 2400 billion tons of carbon dioxide
To stay cen centuries will be determined how we play our cards this decade
I would say we do not have environmental problems in the world anymore
Destabilizing the planet the risk of destabilizing the planet is a question of security for all societies in the world
Therefore it is a question for the security council
It's a remarkable time to be alive but it also carries great responsibility to act decisively
We have no time to lose
We still have a chance
The window is still open for us to have a future for humanity
That I think is the beauty of where we are today
In 2015 his land mark letter called on all peoples across the world to be stewards of creation
and to remember the impact of the climate the world's poorest he not only help make the Paris agreement possible
he continued to bring his humble message of justice and solidarity to so many of the world leaders gathered here today
all throughout he has stressed the need to build a global culture of care that attends to the human dignity of those souls most directly Affected by the climate crisis
it's our great PRIF LEMG to have his holiness pope Francis join us today
Translator: It leads us to be stewards of nature this gift that we have received and that we must care for in to the future
this is increasingly significant because it is a challenge we face in the post pandemic era
we need to keep moving powered and we know that one doesn't come out of the crisis the same way we come out either better or worse
we need to ensure that the environment is cleaner more pure
it needs to be preserved we must care for nature is so that nature may care for us
I wish you great success during this meeting
what a wonderful idea to meet together and I will be with you every step of the way
thank you very much
it's my pleasure now to introduce to conduct the break-out sessions admi administrative regan and secretary of culture have vIlsack and secretary of security mayorkas
I'm thrilled to welcome you all to the roundtable discussion portion of president Biden's leaders Summit on climate
the theme for our panel is climate action
for the next 55 minutes we will hear from governors INDIGENOUS leaders and mayors from all across the world talking about the importance of advancing climate ambition through multi-level action
we have mayor anne Hidalgo and mayor latoya cantress Michelle lujan governor claudia sheInbaum fawn sharp president governor ko on Ike yurIko of Tokyo Japan and Ms HInd on ou oumarou Ibraham thank you for being here
all of our panelists are women it's a testament of how women are raising the climate leadership and using their expertise to create a healthier more equitable global society
these leaders are working closely where national governments to increase our collective efforts to achieve the goals OF the Paris agreement and limit warming to 15 degrees celcIus they are using firsthand knowledge about their communities to make change on the ground spur local job creation and help inform national decision making on climate change
each of their experiences showcase their progress often first begins at the sub-national level and takes off from there
today's panel comes as we mark the return of US climate leadership earlier today the president announced a target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 while American leadership is back we owe a debt of gratitude to our partners overseas
including those we have here with us today
who remain committed to emissions reductions efforts over the past four years
in the spirit of partnership I'm proud that today the United States is announcing that it will resume and strengthen the commitment to the united nations foundation clean cooking Alliance
the US government will work with the clean cooking Alliance other country governments and partners at every level of government to reduce emissions from home cooking and heating
-- Affects livelihoods OF 40 of the world's population
from America from American tribal nations to Tokyo Japan bold climate leaderships at all level is necessary to tackle the climate crisis  our discussion will address a whole society professional to action and
Mentation
panelists you will each have four minutes to respond TO questions
so without further adIeu let's get started
Paris has long been a global leader in addressing climate change from the Paris agreement to the race to do zero campaign that is rallying support from the businesses cities and regions for zero carbon future
mayor Hidalgo you have served in leadership roles for several city driven climate coalitions
can you tell us why these coalitions of cities are so important to building a more sustainable future and from your experience what they need at this moment for a fair and green recovery
Climate is everything
Translator: On the front cover of the "time" magazine from the changing economies to the democracy crisis and all kinds of issues that we see widespread this requires that we change
but also change radically
but what are we changing
We are almost changing everything
and when everything has to change and very quickly that is called a revolution
a revolution that is just as big as the industrial revolution that can create as much hope as the American revolution the french revolution and also a french revolution that we need quickly and the cities are at the heart of the revolution
192 countries signed the Paris climate agreement
mayors were meeting to sign on to the same commitments
but setting goals is not enough
y -- measure our performance
now a few years later not all countries have given themselves the necessary steps to achieve this
and in terms of the reductions that were pledged countries represent 30 of global emissions is currently below 1 of the overall goal
now in cities 60 of the largest cities around the world have already achieved major accomplishments and this is what we are going to see when we can come to glascow and people come together to reach carbon nutralIty in 2015 cities and countries are seeing they are stronger when they come together in the networks like c-40 -- which is our initiative with mayors at the ocd we are seeing crisis that are certainly unprecedent
let's remember that the day after the second World War there was two conferences that helped the world rise like a Phoenix
there was the new global order created and what we saw come out of San Francisco also allowed for these things to happen
San Francisco conference eventually led to the Paris agreement but we are still missing our -- woods
we have seen a number of moments in europe and the US the US under president Joe Biden today are showing us the way
and like many Europeans I'm falling closely what is happeningin the United States
with the two recovery plans the US is giving the US economies the necessary resources $365 billion to cities and other local governments in order to continue moving forward
now what the US is doing is nothing more than a source of inspiration for the eu and for everyone else and as it was said yesterday there's no alternative
what we can say to that is this is the alternative
what I am seeing from Paris reassures me when it come ones to three different things that I would like to share with you
the first is that it's high time for us to change our economic model so it can be sustainable and therefore in the line with the carbon neutrality goal that was defined by the Paris agreement
that requires a new strategy to completely transform the carbon based industrial sector and it requires strategies and collective action and that requires for countries to act and also cities and a private sector and of course unions and everyone on the ground
a new form of multi-lateralism is starting to arise the second message is that there needs to be social justice in the recovery
the health crisis and the climate crisis cannot be solved without the middle class
they are the drivers of our economies and when the middle class is hurt that is when we can see the rise of populIsm there needs to be a protection for the most vulnerable and that needs to be at the heart of our action
democracy and climate are therefore now linked we cannot forget this
the third message that I wish to state to close has to do with our youth
our youth is tired of hearing one speech after another they want to see action to combat climate change and we owe them results
so that our youth cannot pfeel like they are being sack missed and realize their dreams
we need to create a new world order from multi-lateralisms that were based on nations to multi-lateralisms that is based on civil societies and cities that is the heart of the goal of the Paris a agreement and the major responsibility that we all have as we come together today
thank you very much
really appreciate that and you are right we are stronger together
as we all know too well in our United States the cities are on the front lines of climate change both in terms of feeling the impacts and engineering the solutions
as a result cities are often laboratories of effective resiliency and adaptation measures
mayor Cantrell in the wake of hurricane Katrina you were in the after math of the storm and in the city's long-term recovery
as mayor OF New Orleans you have made adaptation and resiliency key priorities of your administration
I want to hear more about the solutions you are employing in New Orleans to confront climate change
well thank you so much administrator regan and of course to our president Biden and our Vice President Harris and all of our leaders who are assembled here
thank you so much
mayors across the country and the world have been doing the work especially over the past four years to implement actions necessary to mitigate the Affects of climate change on our cities
cities like New Orleans as you mentioned absolutely we are on the front lines of climate change as well as the impacts to our infrastructure and aging infrastructure at that
but also our economies as it relates to disasters such as hurricanes and even as we have experienced this COVID-19 global pandemic
the city of New Orleans and our coast line in Louisiana we are losing a football field a day every 100 minutes as it relates to coastal erosion
New Orleans is experiencing as well ashigh rates of land loss in the east land ridge you know we face and we respond to these intersecting impacts on a daily basis
from preparing and recovering from the hurricanes and flooding that displace our residents to building resilient infrastructure that alleviates really in terms of -- it entrenches the inequalities in our communities and impacting our people
we are developing inclusive climate action policies that put our people at the center of on everything that we do
and in 2018 my administration commanded community participation with climate action equity with the working group to explore how these changes OF climate are heightened by our social inequity
the group also led a series of public meetings and provided recommendations on how to implement climate action in New Orleans and again more equitablity
some of our actions we have taken to confront climate change they include a couple of things
one revising the climate action strategy to meet Paris climate goals
we too have embraced a plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 by 2030 we followed a lawsuit against -- companiesto do it immediately taking Office
partnering with local financial institutions to develop green financing options again for our people in our city
we are working with our utility Office to install dozens of electric vehicle charging stations even as it relates to our city fleets making sure that we are moving in the right direction
we have a solar for all program
that is providing solar installations for our low income residents at no cost
which is huge
the most impactful way we are tackling the change I have to say is accelerating our infrastructure program and one that the city has never seen in our history
since taking Office I am spending nearly $7 million a week on infrastructure projects
now a large part of this work is really due to our joint infrastructure program with fema the Federal emergency management agency
we have a joint infrastructure program that is the most comprehensive infrastructure program that we have seen the in a generation
this program includes approximately $23 billion in the total with Federal and local dollars we are getting the projects on the street
I have implemented over 54 projects totaling 473 million in to construction
a 21 of the projects have been completed since may of 2018 totaling $116 million
an additional 70 have gone in to design totaling $598 million
I'm giving you a sense of the work that is happening
and it's ImparItIve that we move the projects forward in spite of being in a pandemic in spite of a massive economic turn that we have experienced
last year the city of New Orleans we were in eight storms meaning the eye in eight storms that placed us in that cone of uncertainty
we also have a national disaster resiliency grant that is with the USs dep department of hou and urban development
we cut a ribbon on the infrastructure sustainability program
the green infrastructure project
it is key to living with water
it will holdup to $9 m9 million gallons of water and this funding in partnership again with the Federal government but we are poised on begin construction on more programs that will store 25 million gallons of storm water again keeping it from going in on our drains and flooding our people's home ones
flooding our community
these projects are reducing our flood risk as you know and so we are just excited about how we are moving these projects forward
but in partnership with epa as well
we support legislation at the state and Federal level to promote coastal restoration as we participate in regional efforts again to develop projects that reverse coastal erosion due to sea level rise
our struggle with sea level rise and coastal erosion is part of the global fight against climate change
so New Orleans's approach in how we engage in the effort now even before the Gulf of Mexico is lacking and at our doorstep
it speaks to the type of uniunified effort that world partners need to engage in so I'm grateful to be here
it speaks to how important it is that our countries that may be feeling the direct impacts of climate change as immediately as others but to actively contribute to solving this problem and solving it now
we cannot wait
there are many sectors that depend on our wetlands and our the Delta of course
it is a major importance to our regional culture
New Orleans and the state of Louisiana we are becoming global leaders in climate change adaptation how we deal with our crisis on the coast and how we work together in a regional level will set the stage for how others around the world take this big and bold action needed again to adapt and to mitigate the impacts of climate change
I want to thank again our Biden and Harris administration with your for your commitments on fighting climate change
also with the focus on creating jobs and you know improving our infrastructure and re -- thankyou so much thank you so much
we are over time
thank you mayor cantrell
From intense drought and dry riverbeds to high temperatures and Pro longed heatwaves places like Australia California and Amazon are seeing surges in wildfires year after year
INDIGENOUS communities across the Brazilian Amazon are districtly feeling the effects of climate change every day
how can we collaborate and try to mitigate the risks and disasters associated with thing
Translator: Good afternoon
first of all I would like to thank president Biden for this Invitation so that our organization can participate and represent the INDIGENOUS people of Brazil bringing you concrete information for these issues these are critical topics for us INDIGENOUS peoples who since always have been active in conserving mother earth
protecting and conserving INDIGENOUS lands
so for us public policies for climate issues are important
the Paris agreement that so many countries signed that is a responsibility so that their INDIGENOUS peeps not only in Brazil and worldwide can have their rights ensured when we talk about forest conservation especially Amazon we are indeed speaking of most of the Amazon which are conservation areas and INDIGENOUS lands
and the INDIGENOUS lands have served as a barrier against the Deforrestation and degratation however the INDIGENOUS peoples must have their rights ensured as legislations define the strategies we need as a country when the agreement of Paris was signed was that public policies indeed must reach their end because public policies in Brazil all technical groups on climate change they have come to a halt
they are inactive
so it is difficult for us when such an important discussion on climate takes place but we lose the arenas that were once available for us to discuss and join in the dialog bringing ancestral knowledge and traditional knowledge
it is so importanter to us to consider science researchers scientists INDIGENOUS peoples are are experts on climate
so our rights must be ensured
lands and boundarys must be set out clearly
that is why we are here today bringing you the voice of INDIGENOUS peoples
saying strategies of conserving forests and bIoms when we talk about a forest we don't only care about the current situation but long-term conservation
the INDIGENOUS Council of
AR ar roraIma has been carrying out studies and those studies show us a rise in water temperatures reg reg regional species of fish that are disappearing
climate change is not something that is going to happen
it has already happened
we see it in our INDIGENOUS communities and we have to be very aware to this agreement between all countries in the world
we must be vigilant so that all legislation in Brazil is actually implemented and carried out because when we talk about climate we shouldn't leave out rights
when we talk about climate we shouldn't forget about territorial rights
so climate change as the Paris agreement calls this topic we also call that the transformation of time
which has already started to have an impact on social lives on the cultural lives of INDIGENOUS peoples and I would like to call Brazil's attention as well as the world's attention to this responsibility so that all financial resources and funds dedicated to climate that they indeed become active and help people so that these funds and groups are not lost only at the policy heavily
we need them to reach the ground level
we need these actions to be implemented in a way that can strengthen INDIGENOUS peoples and their resilience so we can face climate change
we as INDIGENOUS peoples we don't talk much about adaptation
that term leads us to think about adapting to things we don't want to adapt to
when we talk about climate change we talk about fighting changes that we don't wish to see
and what have we done in that regard
In the INDIGENOUS committee for climate change which was constituted in Brazil including representatives from various regions including the northeast where there's serious droughts
we have a plan for fighting climate change through the perspective of INDIGENOUS peoples
we have holistic case studies we have prepared in which we present solutions for fighting climate change
for instance we have a solution that includes seed banks
live seed banks so we can study and identify seeds that are most resistant to high temperatures and low temperatures
to become better organized to fight climate issues that impact --  I have to slow down here
I want to thank you --  Translator: The fish we count on disappears
so public policies implemented in various countries in Brazil they need to reach the community level
so thank you for this opportunity
so we can say yes to life and yes to earth on such an important day as today
which we call earth day
and earth day for INDIGENOUS peoples is incredibly important to us thank you very much
thank you
thank you
we greatly appreciate your leadership
now turning to govern or lujan GRISHam。 GRISHam
you are widely recognized -- tell us about the process and share your thoughts on how the Federal government can learn from states as we consider addressing methane emissions at the Federal level
Well administrator regan thank you very much for inviting me
on behalf of president Biden and Vice President Harris to work with an amazing group of worldwide leaders because that is the secret
we are all going to have to combat these issues together and leverage each other's expertise
and I took a page out of that effort when I was first elected
so like the president Biden administration one of my first actions was to execute an executive order
it established a framework for three critical components
one we joined the Paris agreement
and we set our greenhouse reductions based on that target
we were clear what we wanted to accomplish and wehad a climate task force thatall of the stakeholders you identified in the question
consumers utilities VA environmental groups every stakeholder that you could think of that made sure we could move on the targets and we joined the US climate Alliance
I want to put in to perspective that the US climate Alliance is a bipartisan group of governors that represent more than half the US total population 60 of the US gdp and we collectively are responsible for 40 of emissions
to put that in to context the US still has the worst record in greenhouse gas emissions
for every country represented on this panel
so we have a long way to go
so we set an ambitious target and as you know we now have the leading methane rules in the country that eliminate venting and flaring by the oil and gas industry
and by 2026 requires that we are recapturing 98 of methane you emissions and we are on our way to set the very same targets for ozone rules
we didn't let the pandemic interrupt the rulemaking RA process -- the rulemaking process and the efforts to bring that together
Iwill tell you why it's important
if you are just choosing accountability you are chasing that effort all of the time without getting your entire state in a leadership fashion all on the same page and it beens politically cyclical
a and what we want to establish given this that we are a leading oil and gas producer in this country is that we can show innovation we can set incredibly ambitious standards we can require accountability and leadership in making sure that we are addressing climate change in a comprehensive fashion
b making sure it's not just government verse the industry
or the industry with government on one topic which greenhouse gas emissions or methane
but it's every single stakeholder and every single policy maker in the state including the entire cabinet working together to achieve those results and I will add one last thing
which is given that you are building that and you are using young people everyone is at the table
We also have one of the country's most ambitious renewable portfolio standard investments as we move towards investing in the rescue plan and look forwarder to this administration's network
we are looking forward to having a robust platform as the mayor in Louisiana talked about cantrell
that those infrastructure investments will allow you to heat your current targets and exceed them as we work as a coalition to address climate change across the globe
well thank you governor
thank you so much for your leadership
you know what drives all of us to take ambitious climate action is that in doing so we are protecting people's fundamental rights to clean air clean water and healthier land but all too often our most vulnerable communities are denied those same basic rights
mayorer sheInbaum you speak often about environmental protection as a basic right
how do you ensure equal protections for all people are prioritized in your decision-making when it comes to addressing climate change
Well first of all thank you very much for the Invitation to this important Summit
promote d by president Biden an Vice President Harris thank you regan and all the wonderful women participating in the session
Mexico city has 92 million people and has a metropolitan area of 22 million people
we are leading now one of the largest droughts in the last decades with different implications
we enter the -- we are implements an environmental and climate change program which is an integral part of our policy under the belief that a improving people's well-being is only possible by making the transition that is a -- and sustainable city
environmental change program has seven strategic components aimed to improve environment in all dimensions and at the same time building -- technology innovation but also mainly with participation
one is bringing the city planting 40 million plants and trees in ecological corridors surrounding the south of the city and as well as building and restoring over 1000hecters of public parks
the second recovering 85 kilometers of contaminates channels and water bodies with the objective of converting them in to cleaner water bodies
along with the recovery of public spaces
third sustainable management of water
he with double investment for water infrastructure to improve water distribution and reduce water leaks
use of rain water harvesting keeps it in house for new sources
all the efforts directed to guarantee people's right to water
fourth moving to a zero waste city in 2024 we will be able to reduce by 50 the volume of Municipal waste going to sanitary landfills in relation to 2018 we are increasing recycling and increasing -- from organic waste
five integrated and sustainability mobility
promoting clean publictransportation
500 modern trollIes and cable cars with cleaner technologies and 82 kilometers of new bus rapid transportation system
the Mexico city Metro bus
renovation of light train and Metro and utilization of one car to all modes
six improve air quality through the adoption of standards -- and seven seven solar city in partnership with the national government we are building a solar plan in the city
it will be the largest solar plant that has been built in in any other city
covering 25hecters of rooftops for a plan of 20 million kIlowatt capacity
it will help us reduce emission and improve carbon capture and storage
the goal is that by 2024 we will be able to reduce emissions by at least 10 in relation to we are half way to the target
we are convinced this requires a new development model
for education health access to water and healthy environment part of of people's rights
these are not privilege
the 201COVID pandemic has shown that we can accomplish change in our behavior we thought was impossible
and it showed us the importance of health as a right
but the pandemic also isolated us
let us not elevate isolation as part of the future on the contrary let's elevate cooperation and respect to can cultures and beliefs as the he is essence of the present and the future of our cities and nations
we have to elevate reduction of inequalities well-being for all and cooperation and peace as part of the climate change goals
it is not just possible
but crucial necessary -- from our great city we are putting all of our efforts to be part of this global goals
well thank you mayor
thank you for the ininspiring words
Tribes and INDIGENOUS communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change their homelands and sacred places and the very resources they depend to sustain their culture and livelihoods are increasingly threatened
however tribal communities are already taking steps to prepare for and become more reexhilarate why not to these changes in our climate
president sharp given that INDIGENOUS peoples stand on centuries of knowledge how do you harness that Wiz at the state and national level to ensure environmental protections for vulnerable populations
Administrator regan thank you for that question
I serve as the national congress of American Indians
founded in 1944 ncaI is the most representative organization comprised of tribal nations and their cities
I'm going to thank the special envoy for climate for leading the series on climate
to answer your question the best way to harness the ancient and timeless wisdom of tribal communities is to follow the leadership we have here today and make sure that we have a seat at the table forthwith each climate engagement
it's a historic and sacred moment in time that requires bold creative holistic and inclusive approaches
we thank you for recognizesing Indian country and a necessary partner in addressing solutions
over 15 years ago when I was initially elected as president of my own nation
I was immediately confronted with a frontline impacts of climate change
that year in 2006 I faced a harsh reality
that while millions salmon returned to the mighty river each year for MillenIa only 4000 returned that year
I had to declare multiple states OF emergency and see ourcourt courthouse community center jail facility and only store in town flooded
I stood on our shores long the BUSK Pacific ocean and witnessed miles of coastline littered with dead marine life due to oxygen depletion on the ocean floor and I have taken a helicopter flight to see how far the glacier has reseeded and only finding out that I came face to face with a mountain with not one remnant of glacIal sheen
it has trauma TtIsed our nation
our tribe is not along
our communities share tragic and true very harsh reality story and narrative
but we share something else
we share centuries OF ancient wisdom and knowledge of how to confront climate change are from the voices our ancestors and from a distance both in time and space we have witnessed a world commipletely unhinged in carrying for our relatives
the forest the oceans and the skies
like us they are in this moment confronted with environmental genocide and they need us
I was advised that we must advocate with the samelmon he made the point that the salmon cannot emerge out of the rivers to walk in the halls of congress or stand in a courthouse to make their case before a Federal judge
we are their voice and we have a sacred duty to not only fight to protect all of humanity but to protect all things living
in this moment in time we also as tribal nations not only stand on centuries of knowledge and wisdom we possess the powers and authority not gifted by a state and national government but by our almighty creator to have a clean sustainable economy
all across the Indian economy we are unlocking new opportunity force economic growth and justice
we stand poised and ready to engage in buy lateral and multi-lateral conversations to partner with the global community in a bold climate action agenda
one thing is clear when tribal nations have the space and resources to implement their own creative solutions
they andthe surrounding communities benefit
there's four key points that I like to highlight as we move forward
one tribal nations must continue to be integrated at all Federal and international based planning
and our involvement must meet the standard of the rights of INDIGENOUS peoples and tribal co-management and lastly there must be pairity in climate action funding provided at the state Federal and international levels
in conclusion I appreciate sharing the interests and concerns of the Indian country
we are truly a brain trust of ideas and practices
I look forward to bold creative holistic and creative actions that protect our communities and respects tribal sovereignty and propels us in a bright pro prosperous and sustainable future
well thank you so much president sharp and we agree that tribal communities are a brain trust for us all
thank you for your leadership
Tokyo is among one of the world's most a ambitious cities in terms of its efforts to achieve zero emissions
we will hear from the governor of Tokyo who joins us via telecast to tell us about her vision of decarbonIzatIon in Tokyo
participating in the session I'm very hornered by this opportunity to speak at such an important Summit convened by president Biden
the world is now facing two major crisis
the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate emergency
to address these challenges we must share what knowledge we have and combiner our strength
notably the actions taken by nonstate actors who are on the front lines of this battle are extremely important
the Tokyo metropolitan government is advancing initiatives for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is
to achieve the Paris agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to 15 degrees celcIus is the actions we take during the decade to 2030 are critical
in January of this year we announced that Tokyo will by 2030 reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 from year 2000 levels and reduce electricity by to achieve a these goals last month we updated the zero emission Tokyo strategy
now is the time to take action
and the rallying cry time to act I'm rolling out a global movement to address climate change
allow me to introduce specific implements we are making to do support the goals
a large portion of the city's carbon emissions originates from buildings
to get zero emissions from buildings is a common challenge and goal for the world's cities
Tokyo has a population of 40 million that means we is a lot of buildings
in 2010 we launched the world's first urban carbon trade program
in fiscal 2018 the covered facilities achieved reductions of as much as 27 cared to base year emissions
we are even providing New York city with this expertise
and Tokyo is making -- for more than 30000 small and medium sized facilities to submit energy data and other such reports
is such initiatives are drawing attention from other cities primarily from within asia
in partnership with the national government Tokyo has been providing policy support concerning major -- buildings
furthermore with regard to promoting the use of zero emission vehicles we aim to phase out gas only passenger car cans by 2030 and motorcycles by we will take a multi-facetted approach to encourage the reduction of -- this includes greatly reducing the cost involved including working with the national government to provide additional subsidies and tax incentives
time to act
I hope that our effort as cities will encourage national governments to take action for even greater progress in climate actions
and recovery from the COVID-19 crisis
Tokyo will continue to develop a range of measures and demonstrate leadership to contribute to global decarbonIzatIon thank you very much
well I want to thank the governor for herwords
she is correct
it is time to act
for our final question
we will hear from Mrs HIndou oumarou Ibraham of Chad
the world's INDIGENOUS peoples have been leaving connect to their environment
they make up only 5 of the global population but effectively protect about 80 of global bio diversity and a third of the carbon stored and tropical Cforests
how do we ensure that the commitments we heard earlier today and the innovative initiatives discussed by leaders from cities and states around the world support and include INDIGENOUS solutions to create a more sustainable future for all
Thank you very much and I would like also to thank president Biden for this Invitation and in such a very important event in this important time for all of us
your tool in leadership on climate change is really important
of course after four years of darkness we are all -- you are a smart because you -- there's no way we can solve this the companies have put us in climate change mess
I really appreciate how you invite the three -- to do have an opportunity
this is the starting of how we can all work together
and even we are 5 of the world population
we protect 80 of the world's -- for us protection OF SNAFRP not a policy
it is our way of life
and we have echo system managed by INDIGENOUS peoples
it's much better protected than a national park
with protecting nature we signed the Paris agreement
you all know according to the Ipcc the research said 10 of the solution to the carbon neutrality is coming from the nature protection
let me get you some examples
in my community the nomadIc -- we have an agricultural that is already net zero emission
we INDIGENOUS peoples
-- right now at the same time industrialized countries and culture that emitted 50 or 20
in my community we are already producing a carbon zero
this expertise we do have it from our knowledge
that is why I say you are smart you realize you need us
but also you are likely because INDIGENOUS peoples as my sisters here we say yes we are ready to share our solution
we are ready to build the capacity to the industrialized countries
we INDIGENOUS peoples are have our traditional knowledge
we have our grandmothers
we have our -- that can help to do explai to take the technology from the net zero they are the one who can provide the seasonal based on observation of nature
from the best migrations to the cloud position we use the science and traditional knowledge together to build the resilience of our communities because we know how to listen from our mother earth
and we all know adaptation is global now than ever
because in my country in Chad water is already gone
temperature is already rising to more than 15 degree that is the limit of the Paris agreement
so yes you are lucky
because we will be bringing our solution to the tables but we have also some conditions
because if you want to have help our condition cans are firstly it is time for government local authorities companies to start listening to us
and to stop stealing our land for the agricultural
this is needed right now
secondly we want to sit in the tables
so I do think that head of state Myers all of them they should come and sit in the tables with us
and discuss a partnership
because we have only one plan
lastly we want we represent 80 of the solution
we protect 80 of the world -- climate finance dedicated to the climate protection 1 so it's time to dedicate at least $1 billion to INDIGENOUS people's head will ledsolutions。 ledsolutions
to all the panels continue to be smart
and youwill be lucky to are have INDIGENOUS peoples to help you solve the climate solutions
thank you so much again for the opportunity
well thank you so much and your energy and optimism are exactly what we need at this moment to tackle climate change
I want to thank each of you for participating in today's panel discussion
if for the work that you are doing in your communities cities and states and beyond to ensure a liveable planet for future generations I'm looking forward to working with you and speaking with you soon
and now I would like to invite you to join us for the next two break break-out sessions thank you
you  Good afternoon
we celebrate earth day in the fifth anniversary of the signing ceremony of the Paris agreement
I am particularly grateful to my international colleagues for joining us today
today no nation can find lasting security without addressing the climate crisis
we face all kinds of threats in our line of work
few of them truly deserve to be called exIsten tempetIal a cli crisis does deserve that
as nato secretary has said our core task is to keep our people save and climate change is making the world more unsafe and we need to act
the DLclimate crisis is a Pro foundly destabilizing force
competition for resources and influence in region increases
closer to the equator rising temperatures and frequent and intense extreme weather events in Africa and central America threaten millions with drought hunger and the displacement
as families risk their lives in search of safety and security mass migration leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and radicalization
all of which undermine stability
in the far reaches of the Pacific rising sea level-s and more frequent intense storms put individual families and whole communities at risk while pushing the limits of our collective capacity to respond
the US department of defense has been impacted directly in just the past few years by extreme weather caused by climate change
hurricane Michael inflicted billions of dollars of damage to communities in Florida
severe flooding of the Missouri river in the American Midwest damaged the air force base costing hundreds of millions dollars
and wildfires in California have threatened other military installations forcing evacuations
in February of 2019 a typhoon forced us to pause exercises with our Australian and Japanese allies
Moreover the department has been called repeatedly to support communities throughout the United States and abroad as they attempt to recover from severe weather events
from coast-to-coast accuse the world the climate crisis has caused substantial damage and put people in danger making it more difficult for us to carry out our mission OF defending the United States and our allies
so that is why president Biden has tasked the United States 18 intelligence agencies with producing a national intelligence estimate on the security implications of climate change
and we in the department of defense are committed to doing our partfrom increasing the energy efficiency of our platforms and installation to employing clean distributed generation and energy storage to electrifying our own vehicle fleets
we are not alone
a climate change and stability strategic approach recently issued by on our allies in the uk raises the bar on how militaries can adapt to an operational environment that considers the effects of climate change while advancing military capabilities and resilience
the benefits of action extend well beyond the climate
and include opportunities to improve our own operations
for example when we operate more sustainably we become more physically agIle and ready to respond to crisis
well also have a once in a generation opportunity to build an entire economic sector in the global infrastructure for clean energy
the truth is that our shared commitment will allow us to create a safer more resilient secure and sustainable future
again none of us can tackle this problem alone
we share this planet
and shared threats demand shared solutions
and I look forward to working with all of you on this vital mission
so thank you again for joining us
so now I would lake to take a minute to introduce my US colleagues and our panel
from the US the director of national intelligence Haynes
and greenfield and NATO secretary general and the united kingdom secretary of state for defense Ben Wallace
and the Japanese minister of defense
-- and the kenyan cabinet secretary secretary of defense and the Philippines secretary of finance
Carlos Dominguez III and the Iraq minister of defense -- before we get if in the panel itself
we will hear from director haInes and Thomas greenfield
thank you so much secretary Austin and truly for that introduction and for the privilege of being with you both at this historic Summit along with such an esteemed group of world leaders from around the world and I have learned so much today from you in the course of events
I want to relate to you in a few short minutes why it is in the intelligence community we view climate change as an urgent national security threat
and why we think leaders should be thinking about the role that their intelligence communities can play in addressing the globally challenge that we face
for the intelligence community climate change is both a near term and long-term that will define a generation
it's one that the intelligence community has long recognized important to our national security though we have not always made it a key priority
it may surprise you to learn that the intelligence community has been looking at this for decades
back in the 1990s the cIa opened an environmental center cleared scientists to access classified information
and began examining thousands of archives of Russia asia europe Africa and the arctic with the goal of better understanding how the global environment has changed over the prior decades
and ever since our services is been raising increasing alarms about the impact that climate has over every aspect of our work
as features OF the earth are being reshaped whether through the changing boundary lines in the tropics or the shrinking Heis  -- the shrinking ice in the arctic
we have included climate change in our worldwide threat assessment as we did this year
as it goes to human stability global development and prosperity
to address climate change properly it must be at the center of the country's foreign policy
it needs to be Phil integrated with every aspect of our analysis to allow us to monitor the threat and critically to ensurer that policy makers understand the implication of climate change on seemingly unrelated policies and then identifying opportunities to mitigate the challenge that we face
to do so it's necessary to inject climate science and analysis across our functional and regional work
deepen and strengthen our partnerships on the questions
and learn to incorporate the long-term trends produced by rising temperatures in to our daily analysis in an effort to promote strategic foresight and a deeper understanding of the wide range of interrelated threats that we that are Affected by climate change
for example in a recent report that we issued on global trends we highlight the fact that that the physical effects of climate change are likely to intensify in the next two decades
especially in the 2030s
with more extreme storms droughts and floods melting GL GL glaciers and ice caps and sea levels with rising temperatures
the impact will not be evenly distributed
disproportionately falling on poor populations and will create new vulnerabilities and make worse existing risks to prosperity military readiness food water health and energy security
and yet intelligence services have to translate these broader trends in to the analysis for policy makers that helps them understand the impact of climate change on the range of issues they are focused on in policy areas today
explaining how for example warmer temperatures could push 10s of millions of people in regions such as sub-saharan Africa and latin America to migrate in the coming decades
how the flooding of US bases in certain locations such as the Marshal islands will continue to increase creating challenges for military readiness
how increasing disruptive treatment weather events with trigger crop failures
wildfires and energy blackouts and infectious disease outbreaks with enormous political and check impacts that can change a country's long-term trajectory
and how droughts can lead to scarce resources that trigger conflicts and make worse violent extremism and how shifting coast lines will shift borders and how resources may be there to help with the impact that it's having on threats
and we can help understand the impact that climate change is having on our lives to catalIze am ambitious and promote adaptation and mitigation in every aspect of foreign policy and national security
highlights global developments foreign trends governance choices that magnify or mitigate the disasterous Affects
and climate change knows no boundaries respects no national borders and not be addressed as secretary Austin said is by any one nation on its own
we must work together on the challenge before us
and under the leadership of president Biden and Vice President Harris working with my colleagues across every department in energy and agency in the United States including state local and tribal authorities
we intend to make it a whole of government effort
working to not just protect national security for America but to protect human security around the world
with all of you
and thank you I will turn it over to the wonderful a ambassador Thomas greenfield to lead our panel
thanks thank you so much director haInes and secretary Austin
thank you for your leadership and for teeing up this historic discussion and a warm welcome to all of our diguests here today
thank you for bringing up a challenge we all share
we are looking powered to a productive discussion this afternoon
we experienced in America extreme wildfires in California and unprecedented storms and blackouts in Texas and devastating hurricanes in my own home state of Louisiana
and of course we were far from alone
the world saw Monsoons and droughts and rising see levels
toxic air pollution my point is it doesn't matter where you live climate change is a challenge for every person in every nation and on every continent
and one reason we bring it up s in the security Council in particular it's not just to our selective climates but to our security
the Pentagon has designated climate change as a national security threat and a threat multiplier
that is because unpredictable and extreme weather will make vital resources like food and water more scarce in ImpoverIshed regions
scarcity spurs desperation and desperation leads to violence
once more at the current pace the climate crisis is set to drive millions from their homes propelling mass migrationing that will under mine peace and stabilitiy iaround the world
and so many of the most fragile states and knowledge aregions a vulnerable
we can generate economic opportunity if we work together and deploy every possible resource toward this effort
so president Biden is taking advantage of all of the tools in the multi-lateral tool kit
you could see that represented here today we are putting climate change at the center of our foreign policy
we have a military strategy
we have an intelligence strategy
and a diplomatic strategy
from a diplomatic standpoint president Biden moved TO join the Paris agreement just hours after being sworn in to Office
and earlier thismonth the United States joined the UN's group of friends on climate and security which aims to integrate the climate securitiey nexxus i today is the next step is next major step in our diplomatic efforts
our hope for the panel
our charge in fact is to coordinator on how we can prevent conflict caused by climate crisises and turn this security threat in to a shared economic opportunity
to that end let's get the conversation started
and let me say up front
and I apologize I'm going to be running a tight ship on time because I want to make sure that we hear from all of you and our time is tight
so let's start by talking about you multi-lateral engagement
you have a unique understanding of securityi implications on climate change
how is it a leading voice among international organizations dealing with the security related aspects of climate change
Thank you so much and thank you for inviting me
I welcome president Biden's leadership on tackling climate change
as you mentioned under former UN special envoy for climate ch ch change this is close to my heart
global warming is making the world more dangerous it has a serious impact on our security
so it matters for nato
nato has recognized climate change as a security challenge for many years
now we are stepping up our efforts to nato2030 and I expect nato leaders to approve an ambItIous action plan as part of the overlooking agenda to deal with the challenges of todayed and tomorrow
I see three areas where NATO has an important role to play in addressing climate change
first understand we must understand the problem so we can address it
climate change is a crisis multiplier
from the sahara to the high north
droughts and familiar -- it fuels tensions and conflicts we need to increase our awareness by monitoring and tackling climate change much more closely
to better understand and anticipate its impact on our security
including on the most vulnerable populations and geopolitical competition
this includes investing morein research and sharing data and analysis
second
adapt
NATO must adapt so it can continue TO work in all conditions
much of the critical infrastructure is exposed to rising sea levels and more extreme level
from major European ports liking Notre Dame and hamburg to Norfolk Virginia which houses Nate -- nato command
inKREEGSly our troops are being called to on respond to natural disasters at home and abroad
so climate change Affects where and how we operate
we will therefore conduct an Alliance wide assessment of the impact of climate change on NATO assets and installations
we will prioritize sustainable technologies in our procurement and partner with industry to do deliver new climate neutral capabilities
we will also integrate climate change in to planning and exercises
third cut emissions
NATO must play its part in reducing military emissions
greening our militaries can offer real win/wins
for example by decreasing our dependence on fossil fuel supplies makes our operations more vulnerable
in this way we can reduce our environmental impact and at the sim time improve our operational effectiveness
ally o allIed militaries are increasing biofuels to power fighter jets
integrating solar panels and planting trees on military bases to offset carbon emissions we must continue this progress and work with the private sector and part Americas to drive innovation and share expertise
it makes littlesense to have moreand more electric vehicles on the streets when the military still relies only on fossil fuels
my ambition for the NATO Summit this year is a clear political commitment to plan for a reduction in military emissions contributing to the goal of net zero
NATO is the unique platform for europe and north America to have climate change
it's a generational challenge that requires as global solution
so is NATO must set the gold standard on understand ing andmitigating the security impacts of climate change
I look forward TO working with you to make our planet safer for all
thank you secretary general
now may I turn to minister roboles roboles minister as you know climate change knows no boarders and while Spain's agricultural sector will face climate changes in the years ahead I invite your expertise on water
how is the European union approaching the security related aspects of climate change and what role will Spain play in in these eu efforts
Translator: I would like to congratulate you for convening this at this TIEMPT we know that climate change is one of the most pressing threats because it makes it harder to access food and security
it generates poverty and disputes over limited resources and drives migration flows that are preyed upon with those with enormous human suffering
a threat that requires a huge amount of resources to contain and defeat
terrorism states and communities makes it's difficult for them to pay essential attention to human development and the most pressing needs of each society
the Coronavirus pandemic has painfully confirmed the need for global action
we is have learned that the sons will only be effective if it is based on cooperation between states multi-lateral organizations and civil society
denial of climate change is proof of reality and a serious responsibility
especially in a ruler
we have a moral and political obligation to attack in a concerted and long-term manner the structural causes
Spain is a country that is firmly committed to fighting climate change with the goal of achieving climate neutrality by to achieve this among many other actions the Spanish government is undertaking a review of our agricultural to build more sustainable food chains both in our country and globally
the challenge is to produce more food while preserving the natural resources of each country and the world
using the knowledge the fruits of research and innovation and making all of this available to our farmers
Spain's geo political location means we are particularly sensitive to north after can and the -- which are fundamentally agricultural and l livestock based economies
we feel the full impact of climate change with increasingly intense droughts and increase in temperatures 15 times higher than the rest of the world
d D DEGredatIon of resources and pastures and land is increasingly reduced
the consequences are a result of the conflicts between nomadIc and settled agricultural populations
and in this context conflicts are multiplied we have Nigeria and Chad and malI the central Africa andthe civil war in Sudan
these are ethnic and tribal conflicts and they are linked to the worldwide rise of terrorism
at the root is a competition for those mostly agricultural -- they are in poor communities and the most vulnerable sectors of the population
especially children the elderly and women who make up 80 of climate refuges
yes 80 of climate refuges in the north of Africa
adaptation and resilience to climate change and environmental degradatIon require decisive and concerted assistance of europe
the foreign affairs Council of the European union on January 25th of this year recognized the link between climate change security and defense as well as the need to reinforce and integrate work on climate insecurity
we are working on a road map on climate change and defense in order to move from re-eleflectio action
in the operational area the development of new capabilities to prevent and combat weather phenomenon and disasters caused by climate change
extreme rain and extreme drought
and also strengthening international cooperation in the face of climate change
Spain is well aware of the consequences of climate change
both Hu manmanItarIan and socI economic
it's position makes it's a neighbor and a bridge
we must take advantage of the basises that we share with the United States to make them not only instrumental of military action
but also secretary Austin driving forces in the fight against climate change
attention to the preservation of the environment is a strategic priority
and not only for Spain
and this makes us develop climate neutral military capabilitities and participating in international climate diplomacy initiatives
the Spanish armed forces contribute to the European union training missions in malI and the central African republic
one of the roles we play is with malI which includes the training modernization and the integration of the country security and defense institutions and to enhance the role of human and society because a role OF women in society in our countries is key to areas such as agricultural
the European union which has reached an agreement to achieve neutrality by 2015 is working in Africa
the NATO like the secretary general mentioned performs actions in the southern part as well
and we fully agree with the role that the secretary said regarding the reflections by NATO
we the ministers of defense play a key role
defense in itself does not hold a key to solutions
but it is a part of the solution
we must plan for the future and we must develop environmental plans that are efficient for our armed forces and adapt our operations and develop new prevention capabilities to fight climate change
we must continue working in a concerted manner with civil authorities and do it to face catastrophIes is such as the national urgency department in Spain and it has obtained international reputation -- fires and significant flooding and we must not forget at this point we are fighting the current -- this makes it key to have strong military health services
the century the 21st century calls us to face the big challenges in mankind and from our positions as ministers of defense and responsible for our military and security of our country we cannot under value the challenge that climate change poses
and to that purpose we must develop new solid security and defense policies
even in areas like I mentioned for agricultural in the northern Africa
this is the only way that we will be able to move towards a better world with equal and sustainable growth for all
thank you
thank you minister
I would like to pivot the discussion to talk about the need to adapt to and mitigate changes and impacts of the climate change
and as I said in my remarks climate change is a threat multiplier
it impacts it's impacts have the potential to destabilize regions and under mine our ability to successfulfully execute peace keeping operations and other shared priorities
so I would like to turn to kenyan's -- as a nonpermanent member of the UN security Council and a member of the UN group of friends on climate and security which is United States just joined as I noted earlier
how can the UN effectively incorporate climate security in to the entire UN system
Thank you very much Linda
secretary of defense Austin director of national intelligence -- ministers present ladies and gentlemen I'm delighted to join you in these sessions that focuses attention on the growing threat
science today is clear
what may have started as a degradatIon -- threats across the world
as numerous assessments have been po-- no country or region the world even with scenarios of global warming each will feel the Affects of security
if direct implications and our ability as security forces to defend the people and our nations then it's obviously warranting our attention
that is why I welcome this
the situation is even dire in countries and regions that are vulnerable
because of weak states because of weak societies ability to keel w deal with the ecologIcal threats
most Africa is faced with conflict poverty weak institutions food insecurity epidemics pandemics
leaving communities unable to meet the threshold of climate change
climate change is particularly complicated for developing nations
it's Affecting many as equities OF economics migration human rights
in the whole of Africa whole ecological -- frequent and intense extreme weather has become cyclical
last year alone Africa suffered -- movement of populations within borders two cycles of migrations and a pandemic
leading to human trafficking pIracy and recruitment in to violent extremism and terrorism
in all this the fact of climate change driving migration it is inciting and wars and it is threatening international peace
it is critical that the united nation and the UN system folks not just attention in a number of ways and I wish to show at least five of these
first there's a need to redefine climate security
in the UN system climate change has been on the edge
even with the paradigm shift that brought insecurity climate change and the betterment remained to be -- in view of the science at happened today it's important that it is a core and standing agenda at the united nations
across all of the UN family
this is why Kenya has elected to have climate change as one of its -- in the new -- the initiative needs to be realized
and this also must be reflected in all of the region
second
the mandates of the new world peace keeping -- must clearly incorporate climate change and risk assessment and management it uses the concise language on the vast effect of climate change on security as well as actions that are best related
so there's almost off times it is mentioned climate change I think it's important that the language becomes clearer and firmer in terms of -- this must also be backed by available resources to support both near time activities in the mission
on the ground it is crucial to have the capacity for missions to deliver on the climate change agenda and to reduce the mobilities to do the resilience that enables communities to -- this requires an adaptation
yielding capacity to ensure -- for instance
the on set of disasters requires building capabilities for quick response
this calls for boosting our engineering capabless -- similarity it calls for involvement in mitigation measures
for instance it is important that our peace keepers engage in measures that mitigate the Affect of climate change
and part of this our own expectation to prepare for deployment must have it as a critical opponent
in Kenya we have developed an environmental soldier program who's mandate is to reduce on emissions by greening the country
and I think it's a good area that you can deploy the peace keepers a lot of resource
fourth there's less it'snecessary to have capabilitities in crisis situation
by reviewing and strengthening our ability to protect by the use of technology so you can detect changes
we are able doing manage this in time so we can engage in recovery in hour areas
finally chair is the need to under score the ImperatIve we must involve populations women and governments
and to execute as well deal with the situation
we must go beyond the nation states
because as everyone has said the challenge in our hands transends each
our strength and -- across theaters across sectors and with one another
we must also hold one another to account
to say this public will look to us today and generations to come
thank you thank you Monica
now I would like turn to minister Wallace
minister in your capacity as cop-26 president
and chair of the g-7 how will the united kingdom highlight climate security challenges this year
thank you very much thank you secretary Austin for hosting us today
the uk's climate commitment require's defense's full involvement
defense addressing climate change is right and necessary
climate change is a clear and present danger to the united kingdom it's interest and threat
it's athreat and the challenges we face in Combined with the changing character warfare climate change alters the way our military fight live and train in unfamiliar ways
Where we are now is that sustainability has been embedded into what defense does for a long time
Ministry of Defense due to hurricanes and extreme weather and policies affect stability considerations especially across our estate
We must go further
They must be ready for more stringent and broader green commitments including contributing to the UK's Net Zero commitment by decarbonizing its estate and they must mitigate the impact on the environment
To get there the ministry of defense set out ambitions for 2050 guiding principles methods and the initial actions
The MOD strategic approach is an initial step
Our 20250 ambitions are three-fold
UK defense will adapt to fight and win over more hostile and unforgiving physical environments
UK defense will reduce its emissions and increase its sustainability activity and contribute to the achievement of the UK's legal commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and thirdly the UK defense will act to be recognized as a global leader in response to geopolitical and conflict related threats exasperated by climate change
The primary methods we'll use for meeting the 2050 ambitions will be firstly adaption and resilience providing disaster response to civilian authorities striving for operational self-sufficiency on deployments using the climate lens and forced design participation in the green energy transition
We must be a fast follower of new developments in the commercial sector supporting innovation research and development reviewing and updating our training and medical plans mitigating for disruption and taking advantage of synthetics and secondly driving both behavior and systematic change producing net zero build standards setting carbon targets across defense organizations and using whole life cost building circular economy principles into design sequestration offsetting or capturing carbon by using our role as state natural and wildlife intervention
The question asked me what we're doing this year
We have 37 concrete actions planned for delivery within the year across 12 sections and aiming to make impacts by 2025
In essence the skills of the armed forces are to be self-sufficient and our experience of resilience means we must be on development for our own government but also for our allies if we are to respond to climate change
Thank you very much
Thank you so much Minister
Minister Enad of Iraq defense minister Kishi from Japan and defense minister Dominguez offered their perspectives in prerecorded messages
First minister Naad how your perspective security in Iraq is affected by impacts of climate change
Translator: Good evening
Honorable Secretary of Defense Austin and honorable speakers thank you for inviting me to speak today
It's quite an honor to be here see you speak to the world about the impact of climate change and negative impact of climate change on our planet and I will try to bring an objective answer
Simply the climate in Iraq is very hot and it's a level that increases that makes it difficult for our security and stability to remain sustained
Iraq realizes the impact of climate change as a threat and shares the United States' ambition to reduce carbon emissions and achieve reduction of 1 1/2 degrees to accelerate the different station and threat and security of water and food and presented pressure on our network and our trek lickity grid during the bass rah water crisis during 2018 dealing with drought and increase in sea level which led to instability and increase in violence
Climate crisis that many leave their homes agricultural land and later an increase in unemployment to 60 within the youth under 25 which will drive them towards crime and terrorism which we witnessed as they targeted Mosul dam and we saw what Daesh has done to our country
The expanded network in Iraq enabled the country to manage its waters and to use clean water potable water and to irrigate crops and hydro electricity
Citizens who lack the economic opportunities remain easy prey for Daesh and unless we enable all to go back to their homes and end all reasons for migration the danger will remain and Iraq realizes that the limited electric power is a threat
Iraq's Paris agreement is a step in the right direction to use energy and sustainability to stay on the face of this planet and to reduce emissions and to ensure mitigation and I am w working closely with my colleagues in the government the prime minister to put together a plan so we can fight this fight together
Thank you very much
Thank you Minister
Now I will turn to Minister Kishi of Japan
Japan has experienced various impacts from climate change including the Shikoku floods in 2018 typhoon Hagibus in 2019 and the flooding in 2020
How is the Japanese government adapting to security riskss fro the impact of climate change happening on your land
Translator: Good afternoon
I am Kishi Nobuo Defense Minister of Japan
It San honor to speak at this session on climate security
Today I will begin with my view on climate change as a security issue and make a brief explanation about the impacts of climate change to Japan and how minister of defense MoD is tackling these challenges
First climate change and security challenges
Climate change is a spiral risk a risk that causes a spillover
This is not just an issue about an environmental of one nation but it is a threat to the peace and stability of the international community as a whole
Climate change makes our environment more difficult to live in
For example it increases natural disasters such as floods and droughts
This would create a hotbed for crimes and extremism and disadvise our society
This would provoke more conflicts over territory and natural resources
These conflicts beget farther environmental degradation triggering iterations of next conflict
Through such downward spiral climate change presents risks to the world's security and in globalized world we live in consequences of climate change in one place of the world will have ripple effects global ly
Next I would like to talk about three ways climate change can affect Japan's security
First increases of climate change induced natural disasters have a potential to adversely impact the capacity of Japan's forces the SDF
In recent years Japan has witnessed the frequency of torrential rains increase as the frequency and intensity of natural disaster increased the number of YSDF personnel involved in relief preparations increased and does the duration of the operation
This could be either way JSDF's readiness for national defense missions
The total number of SDF personnel involved in disaster relief operations topped 1 million for two consecutive years 2018 and 2019
In recent years JSDF reserves have been called up for disaster relief operations
The second is the impact of rising sea levels
Oceanic encroachments result in permanent land loss which interify struggle of territory in natural resources and trigger mass vie gragss this is a recipe for nationwide discivilization and if this happens in this part of the world it will have impacts on Japan's security
In view of this as part of comprehensive efforts for regional stability Japan has been in close communication with southeast Asia and Pacific Island countries and engaged in capacity building assistance and other activities
Third is the impact of melting arctic sea ice
From Japan to Europe if we take a sea route via the arctic Ocean the distance can be reduced to 60 of the route via the Suez Canal
Many see huge potential beneath the Arctic Circle seabed
The melting of the ice increased strategic importance of the Arctic Ocean
In 2020 an MSDF fleet a training squad Ron navigated the arctic Ocean for the first time
We believe that freedom of navigation in the Arctic Ocean is very important for the peace and stability of the world
Finally I would like to talk about MoD's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
In fiscal 2021 at least 50 of all MoD facilities will introduce renewable energy for electric car generation
Furthermore we carried out a research project to apply hybrid electric diesel vehicle to ground vehicles and we developed a prototype with the new system in 2014
Currently in order to improve capacity of SDF vehicles Japan is working with the United States to develop this research project
In my view activities for national defense and environmental can go hand in hand
To make that happen -- MoD is going to consider what we can do to deal with climate change in this task force going forward
I have laid out my view of climate change as a challenge to security today so far
Lastly climate change cannot be solved by one country
I will put forth every effort to tackle the issue hand in hand with all countries in the world
Thank you for your attention
Japan has been hit by many heavy rains and floods
JSDF has responded to these natural disaster since its foundation
JSDF has had the disaster relief mission to three disasters as well
However as I mentioned earlier the number of record-breaking torrential rains have been incr increasing
In response JSDF has improved its disaster service response capability by enhancing its equipment and training
For instance JSDF has strengthened its capability of transportation and response by acquiring rescue helicopters cargo aircraft and disaster response runs moreover JSDF has enhanced resilience of JSDF installations against earthquakes and tsunami
JSDF conducts various disaster response exercises including bilateral exercises with the United States forces
Through those efforts JSDF will take all possible measures to be prepared for a disaster response
Thank you Minister
The Philippines is continuing to experience intense impacts of climate change
Minister Dominguez what unique climate security risks to island nations in the Indo-Pacific region face
United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and distinguished guests good afternoon
Thank you for inviting the Philippines to this leaders Summit on climate
Climate change presents the planet with an existential threat
We must do what is necessary
There are painful choices to be made
We must prepare our people to make them
The conversation about climate change is very real to the Philippines
As an archipelago sitting on the belt and the Pacific Ring of Fire we are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change
As the Chair of the Climate Change Commission I am aggressively advocating for the protection of our environment
I am striving to make our citizens aware that as individuals all of us play an indispensable role in this battle against the climate crisis
Behavioral change as one of the solutions to the climate emergency must come first within ourselves and in our homes
Recognizing this the Philippines is pushing for the passage of a piece of legislation that will ban single use plastics
Once passed every Filipino will have the ability to do his or her part on a daily basis in helping save the world's environment
The Philippines accounts for three-tenths of 1 of global carbon emissions we want to become a world leader in drastically reducing greenhouse gases
On April 15 2021 the Philippines submitted its first nationally determined contribution
We have set a high target of 75 greenhouse gas emission reduction and avoidance by 2030
This ambitious target was set to challenge both ourselves as well as the rest of the world
It underscores the urgency with which we view this greatest challenge facing the earth today
We have a unique opportunity in Mindanao to demonstrate our commitments
We are exploring a financial mechanism to enable the government to improve the generating capacity of the hydropower plant and acquire all coal-fired power plants in that region to repurpose them
Eventually it will spur investments from companies seeking to expand their operations in areas powered by clean energy
Within the framework of the Paris Agreement the advanced economies committed to assist the developing countries through financing arrangements investments and technology transfers
We look forward to seeing these commitments materialize
We cannot simply sit back
We need a call to arms
Each person each community and each country must do what needs to be done to reverse the destructive course we ourselves inflicted on our own planet
Thank you
Mr Dominguez and thank you to all of our for all of your comments your insights and for your spirit of collaboration you've shown as we come together to address this security threat
Our time is almost up so I'd like to turn things back over to Secretary Austin for the final word sir
Secretary the floor is yours
Thank you Ambassador and thanks for tremendous work
Friends and colleagues let me very briefly thank you all again for joining us at today's extraordinary Summit
This critical conversation is only the first among many that we intend to have over the coming months and years
Working together I'm confident that we can tackle the climate emergency and I'm deeply grateful for your insights and for your partnership
Together we can build a safer more secure and more sustainable future and make all of our children proud
So I'm excited to get to work
Again thank you all for joining us today
We very much appreciate it
Thank you very much Secretary Austin
And Ambassador thank you so much we appreciate both of you taking on this critical challenge of security not enough people are aware of the degree to which this is a security issue and particularly I'm glad that today you helped to really put it into a clear perspective
The Pentagon has long said that the climate change then a change now a crisis is a threat multiplier and you've articulated it very very clearly here today
We've come to the close of the first day
Tomorrow I want to make clear to everybody in the morning President Biden will be here critical part of that session
We're going to be taking on the combination of innovation tomorrow and the economic opportunities jobs
Bill Gates among others is going to join us to talk about what he's doing in innovation and some of the things that all of us can hope for
Clearly innovation is going to be a critical component of what we have to achieve
As I mentioned earlier even if we get to net 50 net zero by 2050 even if we get there we still have to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
A lot of people don't focus on that and that means we need the animative technologies to do that or to be able to know that we can store it and/or turn it into something
We haven't discovered that yet
And in terms of innovation there are great possibilities
I think I've been amazed by the number of countries that are already really chasing after green hydrogen blue hydrogen and hydrogen I think is something that makes a lot of us salivate a little bit
It may well be our saving grace
But also storage
Battery storage is now leapfrogging in much of the same way that solar did for a period of time so you've got utility scale battery capacity today which is enlarging the ability of power providers to have greater security in the provision of that power
It deals with the baseload challenge
So I think we're sort of on the cusp of something very very exciting and we touched on that today
Obviously the finance component underscored the degree to which it is going to be critical to have the wherewithal in many countries to be able to make this transition
If we're going to ask people not to use the cheapest fuel which in many places still they think is coal if you really did the accounting for coal'  it's not the cheapest because nobody accounts for the health impacts or the warming impacts of the ocean or the black lung disease for the miners and so forth
So it's under any circumstances not cheaper but some people think it is and so they build it out
What we need to do is switch faster to these alternatives and renewables and use the progress of batteries and the cheapness now of solar and we're even on the cusp I am told of having a new process in solar per oscavite layered on to a solar panel raise the capacity of the solar panel by some 40 which becomes more of a game changer
So I am excited and optimistic and I think tomorrow's session on innovation will help to make a few more of you feel similarly
Today obviously with the finance section with the nature-based discussion with the adaptation in resilience I think we really managed to cover much of the waterfront of this challenge
But let me and I think it's been inspiring the thing that's leapt out to me listening to the sessions and being part of this is that first of all so many voices took part and many of you may not be aware of it but we had about 70 nations that have been part of a side bar listening session and I listened to 42 of them yesterday and we will listen to more of them tomorrow morning early before the session opens and it's really been impressive to hear the combination of commitment and the combination of concern
So I think it's important for all of us to close out the first day recognizing that despite all the announcements which are significant we had more than 50 of global GDP today commit to take emissions cuts and measures that will put their country on track to hold 15 degrees
That's pretty impressive
But 50 doesn't do it for the rest of the planet or any of us
We have to get every nation involved in this challenge
We particularly need to rely on the 20 most developed countries
20 countries equal 81 of all the emissions
And as a matter of environmental justice and equity fairness we obviously need to work all of us in that 20 and we're number two in emissions
We know it
I think President Biden today put us on line to move as rapidly as we can to lower our emissions but today all of you have genuinely helped us to envision a world that is powered by clean energy that has good paying jobs that has empowered our younger generations that has thriving ecosystems a world that is resilient to the climate impacts we can no longer ignore and that supports communities that have been marginalized and overburdened for generations
So I thank all of our participants in all time zones
This is not easy
I don't know if some of you have run a tag team and somebody got out of bed and someone off to bed but we greatly appreciate everybody's participation and thank you to all of you who have tuned in around the world
I hope you've been encouraged and inspired even as we know as Chance said in her vibrant comments of frustration with we adults we need to get the job done
So tomorrow we're going to dig deeper into the solutions and excitingly into the benefits of the solutions
This is the greatest economic opportunity the world has known since the industrial revolutio 45 to 5 billion users of energy today rising to 9 billion in the next 30 years almost 1 billion of whom 860 million don't have electricity today folks that's a problem but it's also a hell of an opportunity and if we will seize the opportunity to go clean we're going to make our economies hum as President Biden said and we're going to reach out for the better future that we want to leave future generations
So tomorrow we look forward to seeing you
It's not as long as today it will be briefer for everybody but thank you for being part of this day and we look forward to continuing the conversation in the morning
Take care
Sleep well God bless
Please welcome the honorable John Kerry Special ENVOY for climate
Good morning
Yesterday we heard from public and state from ministers all across governments and public servants at every level of society
The amount of action and new commitments that we heard yesterday was frankly inspiring
I think it's fair to say there is a new beginning as the world is moving towards the actions necessary to keep 15 degrees as the limit on the warming of the planet
Governments and markets we learned yesterday are really tuning in to the urgency but more than that they're recognizing the remarkable opportunity the economic opportunity we have here
And that's what today is about
The world's largest market in history is opening before our own eyes right now
And it's going to create millions of high-quality good-paying jobs around the world especially in countries that seize this agenda
Today is going to be about that vision
We're going to hear from governments entrepreneurs community and labor leaders about how they see the future
But before we dive in I'd like to share with you a quick summary of discussions that we had on the margins of the summit
We had so many countries that obviously wanted to be able to participate but running a virtual summit encompassing 12 time zones is difficult and it's clearly a challenge just to include the numbers that have been included directly in the summit itself
So we listened to in two listening sessions I heard from representatives from 63 countries at the ministerial level
We heard from oil-rich countries biodiversity rich countries and from small islands and landlocked countries who face particular challenges
We had countries from ever everyarea area and I left those tables feeling frankly excited and encouraged
On the one hand many of the countries as you can imagine these are countriesthat are greatest impacted by the effects of climate
Many of those countries expressed concern about the inadequacy of global action to date to meet the goals of Paris
Many noted that mitigation thus far has not been sufficient to keep us on track to hold onto a safe temperature
Many countries including the most vulnerable vulnerablevulnerableexperiencee floods hurricanes and many more
They had to confront these but they lacked the resources to implement those plans
There is polite but obvious frustration that was manifested by many who have contributed so little to the crisis but who have to deal with so much of the consequences
At the same timeparticipants reacted to what they're individually undertaking to attack the crisis but their best attack is resilience because they can have the best impact on mitigation yet they are still enGAgaged with mitigation
Many countries emphasized the critical role in keeping 15 degrees KRCelsius as the limit the warming that we face
Because we know we are already at 12 degrees we have a very small margin to play with
Many have reported they have submitted and are working on enhanced NDCs and I think every larger nation should be inspired by that and many have adopted net zero goals
It was particularly interesting to hear how they are dealing with heavy industry something we have not heard a lot about but which is one of the toughest areas for mitigation
Many participants highlighted their national adaptation efforts
That we have heard from a Carbon-negative country countries that have successfully decoupled economic growth from Carbon emissions
We heard from countries with extensive forest cover that offered themselves up with a nature-based solution
We heard from leaders and Carbon storage countries responding to indigenous communities
It should be inspiring to the major economies that many of these countries or all of them embracing passionately climate action and they contribute far less than 1 as minutes ago
Thatwe'reatthe rule book and what's critical is the actions the outcomes particularly of theemitters in the world
We today will be able to focus on real solutions to this I close by saying that what came out of these conversations with the 63 not able to take part in this part of the summit was that they hear the language from leaders about an existential threat
And indeed for many people on the planet today the climate crisis is an existential threat
But they like the young woman who spoke yesterday know that we are not yet behaving as if it is an existential threat
That is thehope
No one is asking for a sacrifice
Better health with great jobs to grow our economies and to provide for much greater security for our nations
The roundtables contributed significantly to this sense of urgency and it is a sense of urgency that really raises our ambition as we head to Glasgow
I have the great pleasure now of introducing my friend Michael Bloomberg
During his career of private sector innovation  hello everyone
I want to thank President Biden and his administration for bringing us all together
Let me also thank the national leaders taking part including everyone who came to the summit armed with ambitious new goals for cutting emissions
The simple fact is we can't wait for cop 26 to take action
That's why this gathering is so important
We have a chance right here today to demonstrate what strong leadership really looks like
Yes it's about setting ambitious goals but it's also about bringing everyone from every part of the world together and working as a team to meet them not just in government but in the private sector too
I want to emphasize something that I hear all the time from mayors to CEOs too
They say we're ready to do more
We want to do more but we need more help
Sometimes they need more funding sometimes they need more authority and sometimes they need regulatory changes
You won't always agree with them of course but I urge you to listen to them because if you look at the data cities and businesses hold the key to defeating climate change
They are responsible for the vast majority of emissions
So helping them and incentivizing them to take action really is critical
The more action they take the faster we can make progress
At Bloomberg philanthropy we are working to help spread solutions that work around the world
And our company has been working to help the market move more capital to green projects in every global region
By bringing greater transparency to climate risks and opportunities
The task force on climate-related financial disclosures set standards that help companies manage risks and that empower investors to direct more capital to companies that are leading the way
We can't beat climate change without a historic amount of new investment and that will only happen if governments investors and business leaders have the information they need to make smart decisions
Working with partners Bloomberg philanthropies has also helped retire over 60 of all coal-fired power plants in the US Power plants are the single biggest contributor to climate change and they spew toxins into the air
The reality is green projects are cheaper than anything in the world and that's why we're working to reach net zero emissions including our company which is on track to reach net zero by 2025
There is a lot of good work happening in both the public and private sectors just not enough
We have to do more faster to cut emissions
And by acting boldly and urgently we can build a lot of momentum going into Cop 26 this November
We're all in this together so thank you for coming together for this summit
All the best
Thank you Mike and now it is my great pleasure to introduce Brenda Mallory who is the new chair of the Council on Environmental Quality
She has used her career to fight for environmental justice inside and outside government and we're all delighted as is the president that she is part of his team
Good morning Secretary good morning everyone
President Biden's approach to environmental justice is guide bid a couple of core beliefs
First that every single person has a fundamental right to drink clean water and breathe clean air
For too many people we haven't delivered those protections
This is true in the United States but we know it is also true in many other parts of the world
Correcting these historic wrongs is not going to be easy and it requires a long-term commitment
But acknowledging a need for change is a critical first step
I was confirmed by the United States Senate just last week as the newest chair of the White House council
I immediately joined the team that has made environment a focus in the three months since his inauguration
There are three ways I'm going to be working every day to help the president achieve his environmental justice GOELDS
First I chair the White House environmental agency council
This group exists to ensure that every part of the federal government is working to adjust fenceline communities and make a positive difference in the LOOlives of everyday people
Second I'm thrilled that the White House senior director is part of our team and I know we'll achieve great things together
And third the newly formed White House environmental justice advisory council brings together adjustment leaders from across the country to advice CQ and the environmental council on the steps we need to get it right
I look forward to receiving recommendations from this group
Turning now to an introduction of an important Partner we have my friend Peggy Shepherd is a nationally recognized leader who has devoted her life Aal A equi
She has agreed to co-chair and is joining us here this morning
It is my pleasure to introduce Peggy shepard to you
Good morning Mr Kerry and distinguished guests from around the world
Thank you for the kind introduction
Good morning to all of you who are present today for this historic convening
I'm Peggy Shepard based in Harlem New York City and I am proud to serve as co-chair of the historic and new White House Advisory Council
Last night we met as we discussed the recommendations to the Biden administration to advise key cornerstones to his commitment to climate justice and equity into all government policies
I think of the phrase Look at what they do not at what they say
And I'm startled to realize that I am at this convening today because President Biden is acting on what he said and committed to do
And together we're building a model of collaboration between government and communities seizing the profound opportunity to accelerate the pace of action on reducing the impacts of climate change on this country on our economy on the most vulnerable communities and on the workers of this country who need good family-sustaining jobs
And the administration is transitioning our economy from fossil fuels to a clean energy future that sustains the livelihoods and ecosystems upon which the world depends
We must build back better but with justice and a keen sense of our failed history of discriminatory policies that has been systemic
We will build back better by centering investment in the front line communities that have borne the brunt of the environmental degradation that has scarred the landscape of urban and rural America
President Biden is uplifting
The voices experiences and solutions most affected by climate change
We are working to rejuvenate America where all communities have access to clean air clean water safe schools and healthy homes
And you know for me this Earth Day has been one of optimism
For decades many of us in the movement have won David and goliath type victories
We have raised the Specter at this nation's failures and we have begun to be heard
And it's our opportunity for people before profits to center equity instead of advantage
To engage and empower those who are struggling with poverty oppression and racism giving them an opportunity to not only be a part of the solution but also reap its benefits
We have the power to leave no community behind
And as Nobel laureate Mathai said today we're faced with a challenge that causes a shift in our thinking so humanity stops threatening its life support system
We're called by Sister Earth and need to embrace all of creation in all its diversity beauty and wonder
Recognizing that sustainable development democracy and peace are indivisible that is an idea whose time has come
Thank you
Thank you Peggy that was excellent
As you can see I'm looking forward to Partnering with Peggy because she's full of great ideas and she's a great voice
Thank you everyone
How do we reach global zero net emissions
The path forward requires doing more of what we know works now while investing in the critical technologies we'll need for tomorrow
Creating and scaling game-changing innovations that will enable 100 clean electricity produce and use zero Carbon fuels deCarbonize shipping constructing build net equity communities remove Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and make us resilient
A better world is possible
It starts by investing in tomorrow's technologies today
I now have the pleasure of introducing secretary Jennifer Grandholm and Jean Radondo
Jennifer's work is governor of Michigan and her work now has centered on advancing the urgent need for environment al equity with high-powered jobs
She established the first venture capital firm in Rhode Island and then served as its first female governor
She's bringing the same entrepreneurial spirit to the commerce now as secretary and she wants that commerce to engage the private sector in fighting climate crisis
Secretary Granholm
Good morning
This is a week of collective action
These commitments are amazing and President Biden convened this summit for a simple reason
And that reason is that we have to raise our collective ambitions around climate change
By the end of this decade we need renewables deployed at scale so that reliable affordable clean energy reaches people in the most populated valleys and in the remotest mount mountains across the hottest deserts and the coldest rotunda
We need fearless innovation to bring down the costs of batteries to commercialize Carbon capture to make blue and green hydrogen market-ready and perhaps most of all we need a mindset that overcomes resistance to change
We are stuck on status quo and maybe they're insistent that we can't reach our goals
But an old proverb says when the winds of change blow some build walls
Others build windmills
So fellow windmill builders let's push back on doubt and fear
They tell us the scariest thing we can do is nothing at all
Let's prove we can and we'll all gain when we succeed starting with jobs
We are looking at a $23 trillion global market in the clean energy transition by 2030
23 trillion at a minimum
And that means that we all can remake our economies and we can build new businesses and put millions and millions of people to work
For President Biden believes this will be an historic advance in prosperity and quality of life and that's why his American jobs plan our American jobs plan calls for massive investments in clean energy research development and deployment
That's why we're mobilizing American in ingen UUI ty
We'll Marshall our laboratories and universities and our private sector to unlock major bre breakthroughs
We've already announced our goal of solar by 2030 and next we'll start lowering the cost of clean renewable hydrogen by 80 for 2030 making it competitive with natural gas
We're going to slash battery cell prices in half again and reduce the need for critical materials making electric vehicles affordable and maybe even cheaper than gasoline vehicles
And we're going to dramatically reduce the industrial atmospheric cCarbon capture whie ramping up large-scale efforts across the world as well
This is our generation's moon shot
Less than a decade after ted Kennedy declared our nation's choice to go to the moon we planted an American flag on that cratered surface and today we choose to solve the climate crisis
Imagine what we can do by the end of this decade
And imagine if the entire world participated
What if we did this together all of us
For too long this climate conversation has been viewed as a zero sum game one of tr tradeoffs the climate or the economy
No longer
Going big on our ambitions means that we're going to create jobs for millions of people
Construction workers project managers engineers technicians so much more
That means we can all do right by our people as we do right by the planet
We can lift up communities that have been knocked down we can make good on moral debts owed to those bearing the burdens of fossil fuel pollution
This is an exciting moment and our speakers today are going to shed light on the great potential at hand
We're going to start with somebody who understands the power of major investment and cutting edge innovation better than almost anybody on the planet Bill Gates
Bill realized that power comes from not knowledge kept but knowledge shared
He was referring to business leadership but how apt is that this moment in the clean energy submission
Please welcome Bill Gates
It's an honor to be here with all of you today
I especially want to thank President Biden and Secretary Kerry for reestablishing America's leading role on climate change
This is a promising moment
Climate activists and young people especially are bringing a major energy and attention to this issue
They're demanding action and rightly so
And governments around the world are meeting those demands with ambitious commitments
In Paris six years ago here today and again in Glasgow later this year
But climate change is an incredibly complex issue
And using just today's technologies won't allow us to meet our ambitious goals
The reason is that almost all of our zero Carbon technologies are more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts
To provide all the benefits of the modern lifestyle to people around the world we need new zero carbon products that are just as affordable that have what I call a green premium of zero
Now it will be hard to create those products but we can do it if we invest in innovation and build the infrastructure for the transition to a clean economy
This will require doing three things at once
First we need to develop and deploy breakthrough technologies that allows to eliminate emissions throughout the physical economy
Second we need to tap the power markets to fund and deploy these innovations by finding creative ways to finance technologies and level the playing field so they can compete with fossil fuels
Third governments and corporations need to adopt policies that will make it faster and cheaper to make the transition and leaders will need to reward those who take difficult steps
To accomplish these three things international cooperation will be essential
Mission innovation is one exciting example of governments working together to expand and coordinate their investments in clean energy research
I'm also working with partners on an exciting new program we call breakthrough energy catalyst
It will raise money from governments philanthropy and companies to make the large capital investments needed to bring down the cost of emerging technologies
By taking steps like this to create the financial structures that will allow green products to succeed we can build new industries and companies that support communities around the world with good jobs while making the transition to the clean economy
I hope to work with many of you here on this endeavor
Finally even as we accelerate innovation to reduce climate impacts we have to address the climate impacts that are going to come because of the healing that's already taking place
This means accelerating agricultural innovation so s subsistent so they can withstand the shocks
If we take all these steps together I believe we will reach our goal
Thank you
Well thank you Bill for recognizing the urgency of the moment and for answering this call to action
We are so fortunate to have you as a warrior in this fight with us
So as we create these new energy technologies the Biden Administration is committed to helping every country embrace it
On Wednesday we joined the united kingdom and others to launch the global power transfer sector consortium which is there to help power transistors to reduce waste all the while keeping the lights on
We also reduced the use of small modular technology also known as fi First
Then to move the carbon industry further there is a group led by Sweden and India
We are also thrilled to announce our plans to host the 2022 annual meetings of mission innovation and the clean energy ministerial in the United States
We started those two great partnerships under president Obama to engage over 30 of our Partner countries involved in clean energy innovation and today we're saying to everyone that we are firmly back
So our commitment to international collaboration animates this summit too obviously
Today we're going to hear from six heads of state from countries that have been world leaders in specific clean energy technologies
They're going to tell us how they built these new industries they're going to tell us what rewards they now enjoy
First I would love to introduce Prime Minister Meta Jackson
We started with onshore capacity and recently moving into offshore
Wind is a component of their transition away from fossil fuels and we're so glad to have this green energy innovator today
Thank you Prime minister
Imagine you're flying over the sea
As you get closer you spot an island an island with clean electricity clean fuels green innovation for millions of European households
That's our vision of the world's first energy island
And it's not just something to imagine
Denmark will soon make it a reality
Already today almost 50 of Denmark's electricity is powered by wind and we have plans to build even more
Up next is turning green electricity into green fuels
This will solve major challenges for all of us
Emissions from trucks planes and ships
And it will also create a lot of new jobs plenty of green jobs offshore onshore in ports in test and research facilities in industry
We will leave no one behind
In just two years the world's leading container shipping company MESK will launch its first carbon ship
That's what they aim to do on the new innovation on shipping in close collaboration with the US Denmark also supports the agriculture innovation mission for climate
This is another area where we need to increase research and development
Taking the next steps in innovation will not be easy but I am confident that we can do it
Why
Because we have done it before
Denmark turned our largest fossil power company into the world's most sustainable energy company
We have decided to end all Danish oil and gas production in the North Sea by 2050
Today Denmark has more jobs in green energy and the PRprivate sector is on board
We have formed climate relationships with all parts of Danish business
All of Denmark is now united in reaching our target as 70 cut in emissions by 2030
Thank you President Biden for bringing the United States back into the Paris agreement
Let us continue our shared journey into a greener and more sustainable future
I can assure you that we in Denmark stand ready to do our part
Thank you so much Prime Minister Fredrickson
We all applaud the announcement of the world's first energy islands very exciting and all of us in the Biden Administration are excited to join you as the co-leads to deCARBONIZE
Now we welcome of the emirates
[ Speaking foreign language ]  Translator: I would like to thank President Biden for his kind invitation to participate in this important summit to discuss the challenges of climate change and to consider how we can turn it into future opportunities for the next generation
I would like to affirm the commitment of the united Arab Emirates to work closely with the United States and the international community and the private sector and to make a very good change in regards to climate change
Mr President your Excellencey ladies and gentlemen
Although the united Arab Emirates is the biggest in the nation we have made a commitment to invest in low c carbon energy
We opened two of the solar plants in the world and they are among the largest in the world
And we decide td to establish a third plant that would be the largest independent solar plant in the world
We in the UAE today hosted the international renewable energy agency and we also introduced successfully in 70 countries in renewable energy around the world by providing concessional loans to these countries because we believe that this type of renewable energy presents the best future for humanity
And also the UAE is considered to be the first in the middle east to pioneer carbon capture and storage technology
And our oil sector is considered to be the lowest carbon emitter in the world
Your E XL lency as President Biden and Mr gates have mentioned I would like to support the climate
This is a new research to support innovation for food systems over the next five years
Ladies and gentlemen climate change is not a temporary concern it is rather a global challenge that is ongoing
We must unite our efforts to safeguard the planet for the future generations or else this will make heavier costs in the future
Today we are before a new global opportunity under the leadership of President Biden and we join our hands to work together to unlock the major opportunities borne out of this pressing challenge of climate change
Thank you and peace be upon you
Well thank you your highness
Agriculture is in fact such a critical piece of the climate action puzzle
So the United States thanks the UAE for accelerating the research and development necessary to lower emissions from that sector and the United States is proud to join you as an inaugural member of the agricultural innovation mission for climate initiative
We also very greatly value the UAE's partnership for the ministerial as we work on diversity in the clean energy professions
Now I would like to introduce Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
He is a global leader in innovation
Not only has Israel made climate change innovation they're also showing us how to build impacts on things like water scarcity
He has lowered climate action in countries all over the world
At the Israel Energy Center we hope to drive that even higher
Welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu
I have known President Biden for 45 years
We know the commitment for a stronger climate
This is something Israel shares
I look forward to completing a successful transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050
We've already made progress in two significant areas
In coal we've substantially reduced our dependency
In fact Israel is a global leader by cutting coal production
By 2050 we will no longer be burning coal period
In solar energy in the last five years we've increased our generation from 2 to almost 10 this year
We're committed that by the end of this decade we will be providing over a third of Israel's electricity
The challenge we still face is solar energy storage
My government is working to overcome this challenge and make Israel a global leader in energy storage
This will enable us to revolutionize our use of renewable energy
Hundreds of Israeli startups are working on this project and unrelated issues
This company has already received billions of dollars
They'll receive more because I'm convinced that science and ingentgen UI ty will allow us t make a carbon community
We've shown the world how to make water more accessible through drip irrigation and the use of artificial intelligence
Israel is a world leader in water purification and recycling
About 90 of Israel's water is purified and 86 is used in agriculture
In terms of water and renewable energy is also an integrating part with Bahrain
Not only are we committed to find a solution to the climate crisis we are helping cement Israeli peace and that bodes well for the entire region and the entire world
Thank you
Thank you Prime Minister Netanyahu
Very encouraging
I'm now proud to introduce the leader of Kenya a nation on the front lines of climate change
They have taken up the mantel of leadership on adaptation methods and expanding access to clean energy
They've showcased for the world how it's possible to leapfrog a carbon strategy
Here to tell us about those efforts President Kenyata
Let me congratulate the president on leading the world innovation on climate change
I also want to thank him and his administration for recognizing Kenya's leading role in the climate as well as innovation
Ladies and gentlemen climate change is no longer a few crisis but rather a present one
Like the COVID-19 pandemic it is a defining development and security challenge that we must address today
The reality is hard to ignore and the consequences of our inaction are indeed dire
Many of our countries are experiencing extreme weather patents with devastation on economies livelihoods and ecosystems
There is a lot that we can do as individual countries to mitigate climate change and allow me at this moment to highlight a few examples of what we in Kenya have done in this regard
Kenya has determined big climate contributions for climate change in December of 2020 and we committed to continue to reduce our emissions by 32 by the year 2030 in the business as usual scenario
In addition we are also in the process of developing a greenhouse gas emission strategy by 2050 and we will be submitting a report to the united nations for later this year
On our journey in the 2050 target clean energy also accounts for about 90 of electric supply in Kenya
I am tempted to increase this to 100 by the year 2030
As you may know Kenya is a pioneer in Ggeothermal energy
This presents huge investment opportunities across the technology value chain as well as huge opportunities for employment of young Africans across our country
We're also the first country in the world to pioneer well health technology which ensures a power supply of low costs even before the associated infrastructure is in place
Kenya is also home to one of the largest single wind farms of the African content in addition to its exploitation of solar
Ladies and gentlemen to meet the energy needs of the rural communities we have also deployed digital technologies using an innovative pay as you go mobile money credit facility better known locally as Incorpa to power appliances such as televisions and refrigerators
Kenya is already a leader in Africa in developing and distributing clean cookstoves
There is still more work to be done to provide domestic solutions for clean cooking surfaces for 80 of Kenyans who continue to depend on biomass for cooking
We have committed to achieve a 100 clean cooking under SDG-7 by the year 2028 two years ahead of the UN target date
To promote innovation our institutions of higher learning and research have acquired climate technology in distribution centers and we are also working closely with business leaders as well as academia to develop appropriate sustainable waste management and circular economy innovations
And we conclude by also taking this opportunity to raise a concern regarding financing
Most developing countries are struggling to finance climate mitigation and adaptation actions
A recent UN adaptation GAAP report in certain countries to be about $7 billion and this is expected to rise to 4300 billion by the year 2030 if no action is taken today
We therefore need to increase our ambition at two levels
First our country should take the board measures to drastically reduce gas emissions over the next two years and second the better off countries working in collaboration with our private sectors should support developing countries before the financial resources acquired to implement climate adaptation and programs
Finally ladies and gentlemen we cannot win this fight against climate change unless we globally cooperate to fight it together
It is there for all to commit to redouble our efforts now
Let's all act in concert to protect our shared destiny and let us in the spirit the United States has shown in rejoining the Paris climate agreement to bequeath our children a better future
I thank you all
Thank you president kenyata
I love the focus on geothermal
I'm proud that our laboratory has been able to forge with Kenya in the power initiative
We need to do more on geothermal in the US too so thank you for that
Our next speaker is prime minister Ernest Solberg from Norway
Norway is all in with a clean and electrified future
They're leading a global market for electric vehicles and they're investing in clean energy innovation and deployment all over the world not to mention in global efforts to reduce deforestation
That is exactly the kind of big all-above thinking the world needs right now
Welcome to you Prime Minister Solberg
France and colleagues please let me congratulate the US on its new embassy
We need your leadership and ambition to drive innovation and change
We quickly need development in the use of new technologies and we cannot rely on the market only
Paris does have technology in tipping points and a high pricing problem is critical
Businesses must team up new ways to drive innovation and to create jobs
Let me mention a few examples
Nobody is moving at record pace to sewer emission transport
Nearly half the costs are electric
Other incentives such as reduced road tolls has changed consumer preferences
And harnessing vast potential identified by the OSHA panel
We aim to lower global evolution
Our ships have taken on nothing but Seward mentorships
At home we shift our supply to electric and we will have f fisheries
We might connect to the Danish island afterwards
Region companies work abroad including in the US where they will pull more than a million New York hosts
And we make large investments in storage development
Last year we announced the long ship project
Our goal is to capture transport and storage and excess capacity can store more from Europe
And lastly we need innovation to stop deforestation
Norway has made available high-resolution imagery of all tropical forests
This will help to improve management and verify performance
And although it's proud to be part of the coalition it provides for countries that have cut deforestation
We need solutions to spread across borders
I believe together we can align the goal in the Paris agreement
Great great thank you Prime Minister Solberg
Norway's enthusiastic attitude towards so many critical technologies is infectious
I hope you infect us all
That's why really the Biden Administration is so excited today that we're also launching the net producers with Norway as well as Kenya and Saudi Arabia
We'll have strategies that oil-producing countries around the world can look to for their own transitions
Very exciting
Finally I'm pleased to announce Prime Minister elicia Long
They have made progress in making green buildings and they are showing how to sustain cities for the future
So welcome Prime Minister
I would like to thank president Joe Biden for convening this summit
It's a welcome signal to a multilateral climate solution under lined by the US rejoining the Paris agreement
Although Singapore is a small island state we will contribute our share to the climate agenda
Singapore is one of the first to contribute to the UFFC
We have our road map to sustainable development and net zero omissions
Our strategy goes beyond meeting target caps
To overcome our resources and to achieve our introduction goals Singapore must also innovate and use technology extensively
For instance we have very limited renewable energy options
Nevertheless we plan to have reduction by 2025
We are planning one of the largest solar energy systems which will offset 33000 tons of CO2 annually
Another major concern for our compact and density is rising urban temperatures
To moderate this we are using computer modelling for more climate-responsive urban design and planting 1 million more trees
As a financial hub they can push through building
We have launched a $200 billion green investments program
This will help carbon treating sustainable services and environmental risk management
One promising area is using new technology to measure the carbon footprints and monitor abating commitments of businesses
Singapore is proud to share experience in all these areas
We have climate sustainability in the third country training program
And its country coordinator for US Energy Corporation we will work with leaders
We look forward to working with the US and all companies to build a sustainable future
Thank you
Thank you prime minister
Singapore is certainly pushing the model in new developments for new technologies emission verification all great stuff
What's clear from these six heads of state is there is really tremendous opportunity for investments in a broad range of clean energy technologies not only to mitigate emissions and adapt our society to climate impacts but to also boost our economies and create good-paying jobs for our citizens
I do want to thank each of our guests once again for highlighting these impressive technologies and investments that your countries are making in these technologies to inspire us and hopefully share with the world for your commitment to spreading those technologies so we can all rise to this challenge of climate change together
And now it is my great pleasure to turn this over to my friend Secretary of Commerce Gina Remondo to look at the opportunity of the new energy economy and the private sector of the civil society
Secretary Remondo
Thank you Jennifer
Good morning everybody
Like Jennifer I'm a former governor of the state of Rhode Island and I am President Biden's commerce secretary
As Secretary granholm we are tired of having to make a tradeoff between economy and environment
As the commerce secretary I am joining forces with all of you to show leadership in our commercial sector as we look to the private sector for innovations as we've all been talking about and new technologies that are necessary in order for us to move forward in our fight for climate change
It has been amazing to listen to leaders from all over the world and it is exciting to be on President Biden's team to be leading with you on climate
Raising ambition is what's going to make it possible to raise the world's climate ambition and that is what today is all about
Government cannot do it alone
We need the private sector we need private sector innovation we need entrepreneurianism and we need academic research and academic institutions to play a huge role in covering and developing new technologies and innovations investments that can unlock massive economic opportunities as well
Already in 2020 global investments and clean technologies crossed the $500 billion mark
In five decades the new economy will open 5 trillion markets for fast-growing emerging economies
As many of you have said this is a Bunonce in a generation opportunity to export them around the world and speed net zero transmissions which will ultimately as many of you have said lead to the creation of millions of jobs millions of good high-paying union jobs
So it is my great pleasure this morning to introduce a series of academic and private sector innovators who will be necessary to allow all of us to achieve our goals
First I would like to introduce Dr atih Birol
Dr Birol's leadership has led a transformation of the international agency to become the global hub on clean energy transitions
He chairs the world economic forums davos
Please help me in welcoming Dr Birol
Extinguished guests I would like to commend President Biden for holding this summit in his first 100 days of service
It is clear that the level of commitment to fight climate change has never been higher
This is excellent news but I will be blunt
Announcing climate change is not enough
The gap is getting wider and wider
Our latest estimates for emissions in 2021 this year are a warning for humanity
Emissions are on track for their second largest increase in history
We are not recovering from Covid in a sustainable way and there are dangerous levels of global warming
Yet there are ground s for optimism
We will break this year and the phase of electric cars will reach another record high
We will need to transform our entire energy system
This means drastically cutting emissions from trucks ships and planes
We will also need to do the same in steel and chemical plants and farming
We have today many technologies at our disposal
Efficiency solar wind electric power and many more
We need to deploy this as quickly as possible
However our analysis shows that about half the reductions to get to net zero emissions in 2050 will need to come from technologies that are not yet ready for market today
This calls for massive leaps in innovation across batteries hydrogen synthetic fuels c carbon capture and many other technologies
On the 18th of May only a few Weeks from now the agency will release a road map for how the global energy sector can reach net zero by 2050
Make no mistake this is a herculean task
Part of this summit has used this occasion to make new announcements
Let me make one from the IE
Reaching this level of clean energy in the next decade will produce millions of good-paying jobs in the future
But we need to make sure these benefits reach as many people as possible
We need to work all together to achieve our goals and create a better future for all of us
You remind us all of the urgency with which we must do this work and it's a stunning statistic to think that 45 of the emissions reduction we need to achieve must come from technologies which aren't fully developed today
So it's really a call to action for all of us and the innovators in our country to continue to push as it relates to new technology and innovation
Next it is my great pleasure to welcome Dr Shirley Ann Jackson president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Ins Institute one of the country's leading universities
Dr Jackson has served as chair of the nuclear regulatory commission and as a top scientific adviser to president Obama who awarded her the national medal of silence
She serves on the board of the nature conservancy and has had a truly distinguished career
Please join me in welcoming Shirley Jackson
It is crucial we are inc incincubatt incincubatt ING renewable energy
We envision using lipid nano-particles such as those used today to stabilize NMRA vaccines able to generate hydrogen or capture electricons for electricity or atmospheric CO2
In energy storage researchers are looking beyond lithium to the use of abundant materials such as magnesium calcium and using self-healing electrode designs to develop low-cost safe SHLS energy events HOUMPLT there is no inno vase without
To address the challenge we must use the entire global pool including women and minority groups historically underrepresented in science and engineering
Universities are the crossroads for collaboration across disciplines sectors geographies and generations
An innovative approach is required to decarbonize the sectors in our daily lives
Therefore I am proud to announce that the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is launching
HKS and park ins and will and the Brooklyn law school
Based in New York City they will use the most advanced technologies to drive urban environments at the system's level
It will model integrated constitution and supply chain networks
It will link architectural design engineering and a new approach to support infrastructure T UTo maximize human health and well-being
We congratulate Mr Biden for this summit and we look forward to the work ahead
That's amazing
That's exactly the kind of research that's going to move this work forward and we are thrilled that you are making this announcement at President Biden's summit this week
It's f■antastic and thank you for being with us
Now we're going to hear from the electricity sector
I'm very proud to announce Dr merfeld
Danielle is a member of the national academy of engineering
Dr merfield with technologies such as offshore wind and energy storage
On a personal level when I was governor of Rhode Island Rhode Island was home to America's first offshore wind farm and we had the great pleasure of working with GE
in doing that
So please join me in welcoming Dr merfield
I would like to start by commending the Biden administration for holding this important summit and its strong support for innovation
America's right to focus on innovation is a key part to addressing climate change
Innovation has been the history GD。 of GD
Innovation is key to our shared success
So we invest $15 billion annually in energy-related R&D which is focused on breakthrough technologies
Ac Ac Across GE we support the energy sector
It is lower solutions to emit greenhouse gas systems
One example is GE's most powerful wind turbine in operation today
Just one rotation of its blades can power a home for two days
It will power a nursing Nohome the UK
The halyedX and even coupled energy farms with energy storage to provide power when it's most needed
We're also sitting -- such as 3-D printing of wind blades and towers to reduce logistics of TERLDS cost
As well as conducting super generators that will help us generate even more power offshore
Like conventional generators these don't require lower earth requirements
We're also monetizing and DIJ tiesing the grid to ensure lower secur -- higher security and lower costs
To that end the GE foundation our independent charitable organization is offering a commitment of up to $100000 to ensure students in engineering
Developing the next generation of engineers focused on believe a world that works
We look partnered R partners and thereof our global energy sector together
Thank you
Thank you
And thank you to GE for your leadership
It is exciting to both innovate create jobs and provide opportunities for a diverse work force so thank you
In addition to producing net zero energy they will provide transporting that power and using it across the economy
As we've heard from many of the world leaders this morning we'll need to start building smart electrified Ssystems all over the world
I would now like to introduce Audrey Zibelman from the global Ppower sector transformation cons consortium
While in Australia Audrey was a founding member of the global power consortium
She also previously was a chair of the US public commission where she oversaw the electric gas water steam and communications utilities in New York
Not an easy job
Welcome Audrey
Thank you
President Biden special Envoy dear secretary granholm and honored guests
It is an honor to be here today
We must provide worldwide access to clean and reliable energy
Today I'd like to talk about the vital role technology innovation and broad Specter collaboration must have in achieving this goal
What most people don't understand is that the power system only works if the supply of electricity balances with the amount being used every moment of the day
This has always been a difficult engineer challenge but even more when it comes to the grid
Climate change is only making this task harder
Just over a year ago I was in the control room with my team working to keep the lights on during unprecedented bush fires
The limitations on our modelling and Visualization tools meant we had to work on modern innovation
Because it was all they had we relied on experience rather than data to make critical decisions
We were successful however as we know from recent events in California this is not always the case
The greatest fear of an operator is the inability to keep the power on especially when our communities are most vulnerable
It is possible to run reliable power systems on renewables but we urgently need smarter investments and better Software to make it work
That's why last year Australia formed the global PGlobal Power Transformation Consortium or the GPC。 GPC
I'm honored to formally announce today that the United States and united kingdom are joining the GPST and grateful that US secretary Granholm helped us launch the GPST formally
I'd like the energy industry to join X in the moonshine of the electrical grid and the work to combat climate change and build a greener economy
Our team has been working with partners to develop the tools required to move our grids out of the industrial age and into the age of intelligence
I look forward to working with GTSC members and making this a reality worldwide
Thank you
Thank you AAudrey for this exciting presentation and thank you for reminding us of the very real and dangerous consequences of not doing this work and not innovating with urgency
Last but certainly not least it is my great pleasure to introduce Anna Borg who has a long and distinguished career in the energy sector
Anna is the president and CEO of a Swedish multinational power company which has been a leading innovator is using green hydrogen to decarbonize highly industrial processes
Prior to that she was the CEO of this company and as I said has a long and distinguished career in the energy sector
Welcome Anna
Thank you Secretary for the nice introduction
Thank you President Biden and Secretary Kerry for your leadership
With the United States entering the global climate arena and Paris agreement you can count on Sweden as a Partner in this critical work
It is encouraging to hear that the United States is now joining the lead at initiative
Vattenfall is one of the largest electric companies in Sweden
They had a goal of limiting fossil fuels
This is our business strategy and it is sustainable
We are not just phasing out fossil emissions from our own operations we are working in close partnerships with our customers to help them do the same
We have more than 100 years of experience of innovation in a larger growing portfolio of sustainable fossil-free electricity
We believe we can drive innovation through electri fic electrificaton
The key is to replace the coal used in the existing process with hydrogen using fossil-free electricity
This is the biggest shift in the steel-making industry in 1000 years
Together we have built a pilot plant in the Swedish town of lulu and this year it will have the first fossil fuel work
This is no longer a vision
It's happening and it has the potential to change the world
Hybrid is not the only initiative emerging from Sweden
There is a growing industry cluster around mining steel and new intense businesses like battery production for electric cars
One of the main problems now is finding all the people needed to work in these industries and projects
The current technology development is dramatically driving costs down for CO2-free technologies
The single thing for this transition in Europe is there is a need for Mining and chemical industry
I commit to make sure that we meet the targets in the Paris agreement by facing our fossil emissions from our operations and by enabling our customers to do the same
Transforming into sustainable business is not only possible it is the way to have a competitive edge in the future
And the future is not happening in 2050
All of us are creating it here and now
Thank you
Thank you thank you Anna
Vattenfall is doing amazing work
The thought of producing steel without reliance at all on fossil fuel is very exciting
And it is just one of the many innovations that your company and other companies are moving on
So that concludes the portion of this panel for the nongovernmental speakers
I will simply thank you all for participating
Thank you for your work
And again I think that what we just heard from the -- from the private sector is how important it is for this to be a public/private partnership the entire way through if we're going to do the work that is required
So thank you all
With that I'll turn it back over to secretary Granholm
Thank you for a rapid turnover
Gina thank you so much for your stewardship and Jennifer and likewise you both brought special energy no pun intended to this session
And we're deeply appreciative for it
In a few moments President Biden is going to rejoin and he will lead the last session and be here throughout it
As we hear about the extraordinary possibilities of the new economy
But let me just say very very quickly about the session we just heard I've been at this for a while and I sat and listened to people in many different venues but I have to tell you this was exciting this was energizing
It is incredible to listen to what the leaders of Kenya Israel Norway uae Singapore Denmark were telling us is happening now
And what was fascinating about that is that each of those countries are smaller than the 20 that are providing 81 of all the emissions
So if ever there was an underscoring of the challenge that we face here there are exciting things happening
Unbelievable things happening
But as Dr Birol reminded us as a community of nations writ large we are not getting the job done
And what President Biden decided when he determined to have this summit was the key must be the raising of ambition
Country after country has stepped up but the test is going to be not in the rhetoric as Dr Birol said
It is going to be in whether or not we really buckle down and get this done
It is not a lack of capacity
It is an apparent lack of willpower in some places to move as fast as we are able to move
The bright future that awaits us on the other side of this transition is what President Biden wants to focus on as the last session of this gathering
So without further ado with that I thank everybody for taking part in this particular session
And in a moment we're going to listen to the economic benefits and jobs once in a generation opportunity that we have to transition our economies and to do better for our people as well as for the planet itself
We look forward to that session
Thank you
Snow  Ladies and gentlemen the President of the United States
Well welcome back
Thank you all again all the world leaders who joined us thank you for joining and John thank you for putting this together
We made great progress in my view so far
I'm thankful to all the leaders who announced new commitments to help us meet the existential threat of climate change
This summit is a start
A start of a road that will take us to Glasgow for the UN climate change conference in November where we're going to make these commitments real
Putting all of our nations on a path to a secure prosperous and sustainable future
Today's final session is not about the threat of climate change poses
It is about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides
It is an opportunity to create millions of good paying jobs around the world and innovate -- and innovative sectors
Jobs that bring greater quality of life greater dignity to the people performing those jobs in every nation
For a line worker electricians utility workers line transmission lines connecting battery storage and making our electric grid more modern for automotive workers building cars trucks and buses skilled workers installing and charging stations to accommodate them throughout our countries construction workers engineers Insta laters upgrading our schools and commercial buildings and constructing new energy efficient homes
Manufacturing manufacturing work -- nuclear and carbon capture technologies solar panels and wind turbines
And people working in the fields that we haven't even conceived of yet on farms on factories in laboratories and universities the things we haven't even thought of so far
This challenge and these opportunities are going to be met by working people in every nation
And as we transition to a clean energy future we must ensure that workers who have thrived in yesterday's and today's industries have as bright a tomorrow in the new industries as well as in places where they live in the communities they have built
When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure we create opportunities for everyone
That's at the heart of my jobs plan that I proposed here in the United States
It is how our nation intends to build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot
As you heard in the last session requires investing in innovation
That's why I asked the secretary of energy my energy secretary Jennifer Granholm you saw earlier to speed the development of critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis
No single technology is the answer on its own
Because every sector requires innovation it to meet this mome
This critical effort is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around the world and lower the cost of what we're paying now for polluting the air so badly
We're going to move to net zero in transition in all countries
Look every country will need to invest in new clean energy technologies as we work forward and to deal with net zero emissions
I am also very proud to announce the United States is again becoming a key leader in mission innovation
We help launched the program during the Obama/Biden administration a pact between the largest economies to ramp up investments in clean energy research and development
And today America is once again stepping into the leadership role
We will be joining and partner with the nations to decarbonize critical sectors across the board including industrial sector where we'll join with Sweden and India and leadership group for -- for industry transition
Power sector where we'll work along side the united kingdom to spread progress and speed it up toward a carbon free power system
Both here and around the world
In agriculture the agricultural sector we'll launch the agricultural innovation mission for climate with the united Arab emirates and other partners
We also -- I'm very heartened by President Putin's call yesterday for the world to collaborate and advance carbon dioxide removal
And the United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries in that endeavor
Great promise
This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our children our grandchildren and all of us to thrive to thrive and not just now but beyond for the next generations
Nations that work together to invest in the clean air economy will reap rewards for their citizens
The United States is committed we're committed to making those investments to grow our economy here at home while connecting with markets around the world
For example we're launching a new global partnership for climate smart infrastructure this will create good paying jobs here in America by supporting development of new clean energy -- in our countries
These are the sort of partnerships that will be good for all of us
I think they'll have additional benefits just working together
Today I'm excited to welcome my counterparts in Spain Nigeria Vietnam and Poland to share their thinking on how to realize the economies -- the economic opportunities of the climate response
And we're going to be joined by labor and business community leaders from around the world to talk about what's happening in their communities around climate-related jobs
And I'm pleased to be joined by secretary Buttigieg secretary Tai and national climate adviser Gina McCarthy chair of my national climate task force
I look forward to our conversation and making more progress more progress throughout the day
Thank you
Mr President what do you think about the Brazilian President's speech yesterday
Okay
Thank you so much Mr President
Okay
Thank you Mr President
It is now my pleasure to introduce the prime minister of the kingdom of Spain prime minister Sanchez
The floor is yours
Hello your Excellency distinguished participants
I thank President Biden for this summit and I commend his renewed determination and commitment to the Paris agreement
I fully agree that this is the only possible way to overcome what we defined yesterday as the existential threat of our time
Significant action is needed to fight the current climate emergency and the European union including Spain is one of the climate leaders has been consistently working towards that goal
We must use this historical opportunity to fast-forward the transition toward net zero emission future
But also $10 trillion would be mobilized for global 19 recovery the first signs are not too encouraging
The world is calling us to act
This week 101 Nobel Laureates addressed their call to stop fossil fuel expansion
I would like to reply to them today
Spain hears you loud and clear and we are determined to act on it
I would like to focus on how this transition should look like
Let me share with you three message
The first climate action has to put people at the center
The process -- and governments must support proactively the regions and communities negatively affected
Helping form challenges into opportunities
Investing in climate ambition and just transition policies today makes better economic sense
The experience shows ecological transition over the last three years we have closed our mines and most of our coal-power plants as part of our energy transition strategy
By 2022 we will have phased out 85 of the generation capacity in 2018
This achievement needs to be done through social dialogue
Thanks to engagements with worker unions business organizations and local authorities we carved out agreements in order to challenge direct investments restore areas supporting industrial projects with trained workers and protect the small and medium enterprises
We're currently working with the affected regions to attract some of the most -- including renewable energy renewable or energy matching and both the challenges of this transition
The second message is that I firmly believe that the ecological decision offers extraordinary opportunities
Investing in energy transition technologies can create close to three times more jobs than the fossil fuels for each million dollars spent
In my country Spain the plan estimates that more than 230 billion euros will be mobilized over the next decade
This private and public investment will create between 250000 and 350000 jobs many of them in the manufacturing and construction sectors
Furthermore our new COVID recovery plan will enable us to mobilize an unprecedented volume of mining
We will benefit from up to 140 billion euros in transfers and loans over the next six years
And nearly 40 of those funds will be allocated to ecological transition related investments
And finally ambitious actions need to be answered on a stronger framework
This is why we are just approving our climate change and energy transition deal which turns into neutrality by 2050 and sends a strong and clear message to the market providing the certainty
Ladies and gentlemen Spain has been leading by example
We have learned a lot in the process and we are keen to share our experience because we know that addressing climate change is a global endeavor
We must act collectively we must act now and we must not leave anyone behind
I thank you
Thank you Mr Prime minister for sharing your work on advancing high quality jobs within your decarbonization strategy
It is now my pleasure to introduce the President of the federal republic of Nigeria President Buhari
Welcome
Thank you
Your Excellency it is -- I would like to express my profound appreciation of the President of the United States his Excellency Joe Biden for convening this at a time in the world is experiencing tremendous vulnerability from the coronavirus pandemic and climate change impacts among several other global challenges
If climate change has taken the front banner globally as its effect can be seen and felt all around us ranging from increasing atmospheric temperature to rainfall and sea level rise and glacial ice
The Biden administration was a positive decision of returning the United States to the Paris agreement
In addition bringing about abundant economic opportunities to the United States economy
The move complements global economies to lower carbon development
It is instrumental in galvanizing high level support with implementation of the Paris agreement and it is characterize ed as well as inviting more countries and stake holders to take more climate-oriented priorities
As one of the most vulnerable nations Nigeria has undertaken environmentally sound and climate friendly program s proge path of sustainability
Since signing the Paris agreement in 2016 Nigeria has rolled out several -- institutional frameworks -- and conditionally and 45 conditionally with initiative support Nigeria is convinced that through net zero transition prospects are available for job creation and other economic benefits
We are expeditiously implementing programs that stimulated gradual transition away from the -- you could find natural gas biogas and elect electricity
Immediate effects include healthy competition and productivity employment
The agriculture production and supply chain sector we are targeting improved efficiency and productivity through the provision of accurate and timely weather forecasts to farmers supply of drought tolerant and empow empowerment of sources of livelihood
By 2030 the oil and gas sector has undertaken steps for diversification risk management systems assurance in research and development and energy crisis
The Nigerian government in 2017 launched the green program with a commitment to maintain the Paris agreement signed on September 21st 2016
The overall outcome has translated into food supplies improved nutrition less hunger increased employment more job opportunities better livelihood reduced poverty decreased vulnerability to health challenges and higher quality of life
Nigeria calls on countries to embrace the economy and sustainable production and consumption orders in order to Sexpedite attainment of the agreement
We reiterate Nigeria's commitment for climate action and extend support to regional continental and global multilateral processes for attainment of the objectives of the Paris agreement
Thank you
Thank you Mr President for highlighting the incorporation of green jobs into the recovery from the health and economic crisis in Nigeria
It is now my pleasure to introduce the President of the socialist republic of Vietnam President Phuc
We look forward to your remarks
The honorable Joe Biden President of the United States of America prime ministers ladies and gentlemen I thank President Biden for inviting me and other leaders to this very important summit
The United States return to the Paris agreement I believe that the renewed leadership and strong commitment that President Biden posed during the opening session combined with our shared efforts will lead us on a path toward achieving the goals of Paris agreement
Mr President ladies and gentlemen climate change is a major existential crisis
In Vietnam last year alone extreme weather has taken hundreds of lives and reversed decades of progress in poverty reduction
The rice bowl and the home to more than 20 million Vietnamese is suffering for rising sea level especially towards the end of the century
Mr President ladies and gentlemen transitioning to a green net zero emission economy is an inevitable trend
This is a challenge but will also bring about big opportunities jobs energy security and sustainability
Vietnam resolves to follow this path
The same time we need a suitable road map for countries
Accordingly I wish to highlight the following points
First transition must be just and inclusive
It must ensure equal access opportunity benefits placing people at the center and leave no one behind
It must be supported by the people businesses and communities
Second developed countries must continue to take the lead in emission reduction commitment while giving greater concrete support to good developing countries including Vietnam in financing in new technology development in high quality and efficient infrastructure and in job creation
We welcome and hope to receive the assistance from the US international climate finance plan and our international financial arrangements including from its national companies and cooperations
Third the pursuit of climate goals should be compatible with each country's conditions including the need to Alter lifestyles production and work
This endeavor must be integrated into international development strategies and plans
Each country must itself make efforts in good use of international aid and resorurce oversight and evaluation of implementation to improve the ability to recover
Vietnam is a developing country our industrialization has only truly begun three decades ago yet we make every effort to contribute to the global action Vietnam have been quick to summit the mbcs to the United States and mainstream them into our domestic law for earnest enforcement
By 2030 we pledge to reduce emission by 9 with our domestic resources
27 is provided international support bilaterally and multilaterally
We will increase the share of renewables in the total energy primary supply 20 by 2030
We will reduce greenhouse emission intensity per gdp by 15 and methane emission from agricultural production by 10
Earlier this month the Vietnam launched a program to plant a billion trees by 2025
This project alone is expected to absorb 2 to 3 of the emission by 2030
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I'm confident that the challenges of climate change shall be drivers for solidarity and positive change as we move towards the more sustainable future for generations to come
Thank you very much
Thank you Mr President for sharing your thoughts on the intersection of renewable investments in job creation
It is now my pleasure to introduce the President of the republic of Poland President Duda
The floor is yours
-- ladies and gentlemen Presidents prime ministers secretaries of state advisers first and foremost let me start by thanking President Joe Biden for inviting me to the summit
Poland plays a very active role in the global climate policy
Let me just mention that it was a huge reduction surplus of co2 that we managed to accomplish the commitments of the protocol from 1997
This surplus was the 6 reduction and in our case we managed to reduce by as many as 27 because the reduction was Three times Poland hosted climate cop conferences
In 2018 at cop 24 we developed under the polish leadership the rule book as well as the solidarity and just transition cooperation
This paved the way for the adoption of the Paris agreement and allowed to enhance the importance of human dimension in the spirit of the principle that nobody should be left behind
The momentum given by Poland at cop 24 has contributed to the European union becoming the first global economy to adopt the goal of climate neutrality by 2015
And to further decrease its emissions by 2030 by at least Poland participates in these ambitious efforts
We're also pleased that a number of states have followed in the eu's footsteps
Let me mention that climate is the subject to which the initiative attaches great importance
Like other central Europe countries in recent days I've talked to the Presidents of Slovenia Lithuania and Bulgaria who currently holds the presidency of the three initiative and it is clear to us that we have to implement an ambitious climate policy based on the principles of just transition
Taking into account the realities of our countries and the welfare of our societies
This is a challenge especially where there is a need to conduct economic changes including the possible closing down of third industrial sectors like coal sector
These are very serious challenges for states such as Poland or Bulgaria
The climate policy is going t o discussions during our meeting in July
The capitals of Bulgaria
Let me stress however all of us acknowledge climate goals served by the European union and all of us have ambitions to implement them
Ladies and gentlemen by pure political decorations we have to change the reality
That is why Poland plans to zero energy system over next two decades shanks to which the share is going tp from the current 70 t as little as 11 in 2018
This is not only an answer to the agreements within the European union but this gives the response the expectation of the new generation of poles young generation
This week I met the youth climate council which brings together young representatives in Poland who fight for natural environment and climate protection
They expect the implementation of ambitious climate goals and at the same time they're fully aware of how difficult this road is
And perhaps more satisfied to communicate to you you ladies gentlemen yesterday in Poland in our country we entered into an agreement after long social dialogue between Miners coal Miners and the government
This respects phasing out call from the production of electricity by 2039
I believe ladies and gentlemen this is a huge success of the social dialogue we have been having in Poland
This is also a great and ambitious plan for the future
If we consider that today coal to produce electricity in Poland is about 7 0
Therefore Poland will be sustainable low emission energy mix based on nuclear and renewable energy
As well as gas
Unless we apply all available Tennells the transformation of our energy system will simply not be possible
Polish US agreement on the power program dated October 2020 confirms our ambitions
It highlights the importance of international cooperation in the field of energy and climate policy
We should therefore coordinate international research and development efforts to create a critical mess of affordable technologies and innovative technologies which are also price affordable
We should also think how central banks in our countries can support energy transformation in line with the principle of technology neutrality
A climate friendly transition provides a huge opportunity also for our citizens and all sectors of our economy
That is the reason why Poland has placed in the center in the public and individual transport
It offers a powerful chance to develop our industry and to create new jobs
Already now we are the biggest exporter of e-buses in the European union with 46 share in the European market recorded last year
Furthermore Poland has become a European leader in the production of lithium ion batteries
We are ambitious also in the sector of individual transport and plans to phase out combustion engines which I believe will open up a vast potential for cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic
We also attach considerable importance to mitigation
Polish governmental agencies state forests has implemented a pilot program of forest carbon farm F f farms
It stimulates the absorption of co2 from the atmosphere and accumulate it within the first ecosystem and in wood products
The concept of forest syncs carbon farms deserves to be legitimized as part of international legal order
Ladies and gentlemen the pandemic has brought the world to a halt for a moment
While getting back on the track of development let's make sure that this is not the old track
Let us build a synergy between the following three conventions
Convention on climate change on biological diversity and to combat desertification
I thank you
Thank you Mr President for sharing the role of workers in particular in your decarbonization strategy
I would now like to recognize my good friend and colleague the United States secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg
Thank you
Thank you President Biden for your leadership on this defining issue of our time
Thank you ambassador Tai for everything you're doing in the US and around the world
We are here to charter new paths forward to confront the climate crisis
Achieving our climate goals will create new jobs and harness the ingenuity of  our industries and workers
In the US the transportation sector is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases
Which means that the sector has the opportunity to be among the biggest parts of the solution to climate change
The race against climate change is not just a question of what will be lost if we fail
It is about what can be gained if we succeed
For nations that successfully transition to a cleaner economy the result will be jobs and economic growth
We are certainly recognizing that potential in the United States
President Biden recently introduced the American jobs plan
It represents a once in a generation opportunity to modernize our national infrastructure so our economy and our climate can thrive
With its investments in electric vehicles public rail road redesign for pedestrians and sustainable innovative materials this plan will move us away from our fossil fuels and toward net zero carbon emissions
The plan is fundamentally an investment in our economy and our collective future
It will create millions of good jobs for the workers who will make our roads and bridges more resilient lay new train lines expand public transit install electric vehicle chargers and manufacture the vehicles that will depend on those chargers
And the majority of these new jobs will be available to workers without a degree
At least 40 of the benefits of the plan's climate investments will flow to underserved communities which often bear the burden of transportation pollution and are at high risk of climate disruption
If our planetary warming exceeds 15 degrees celsius the impacts will be catastrophic for all of us
We still have an opportunity to prevent that if the depth of our commitment meets the urgency of this challenge before us
And that is why this gathering is so important
We are all in this together
Pursuing a net zero goal is not a zero sum gain
We all benefit if we succeed
If this pandemic has taught us anything it is how interconnected we are and how capable we are of change
Successfully combatting climate change and reaping the full economic benefits will depend not only on transportation but on all sectors
Not only on creative ideas but on workers literally building the future
Not only on the choices of any one nation but on the contributions of countries all over the world
I thank President Biden and the leaders here today for meeting this moment with the urgency and courage required
Let us continue to chart this path together for the benefit of the many peoples we serve and the one climate we all share
I'm now pleased to introduce national climate adviser Gina McCarthy who is helping to coordinate the all society approach you will hear about in this roundtable
Thank you for the introduction secretary Buttigieg and for all of the work that you're doing and I'm excited to have a chance to help moderate in an outstanding panel of entrepreneurs and business people so I'll keep my remarks short so we can dive right in
From the start one of the guarding stars of our whole of government approach to climate action has been how we make the most of the opportunities that combatting climate change actually presents to all of us
So as we work to develop our nationally determined contribution one of the most important things was understanding how it positioned our workers and our industries to tackle the climate crisis
President Biden is always believed that tackling the climate crisis presents an incredible economic opportunity
And the fact is that creating jobs and tackling climate change actually can go hand and hand and it must
And that's why I'm so pleased to be talking to you today because -- in what anyone else you understand the opportunities we have to create good paying union jobs to improve public health to keep our communities safe and to advance the issue that is so important to all of us the issue of environmental justice
And showing the opportunity is already here and it is only going to grow alongside our ambition so long as we invest in our infrastructure and innovation and our workers and in our communities
And I'm excited to hear how you are already unlocking those opportunities so let's dive right in to the conversation
So first let me start with Sharan Burrow the general secretary of the international trade union confederation
Sharan you have a long history of advocating for workers around the world
And have led the international trade union confederation for over a decade
As the global voice for the world's working people with over 200 million members and 163 countries can you please share with us your vision for what ambitious climate action means for our global workforce
Thank you
And it is a pleasure to be with you
Let me congratulate President Biden for the leadership on climate
We really appreciate his commitment not just to reduce emissions which is vital but to make the climate challenge with jobs climate-friendly jobs
This is central for a just recovery for the US but also the foundation of the new social contract for working people and their families everywhere
Jobs good jobs union jobs with human and labor rights and living wages with the freedom to organize and bargain collectively with social protection to support people in times of crisis
That's at the heart of the just transition
To stabilize the planet with net zero economies by 2050 we all know we have to get at least half of the job done by 2030
But it cannot repay past transitions that left workers and their communities stranded
The labor movement fought for and won global rules for just transition
First in the ilo and then in the Paris agreement
These mean workers in the unions must be at the table as we plan the transition
And we know this means for every sector the foundation is clean energy but all technologies must be deployed in manufacturing transport agriculture construction services and the supply chains
We know our cities are a vital part of the equation
And you have so many great means because they accept responsibility for 40 of emissions and that the demand and supply relationships from those cities can generate sustainable production and services to fuel community renewal with decent work in rural communities in our own countries and if global trade is reformed to meet the same sustainability standards with human and labor rights and C compliance respected around the world
A good example of that right here -- right there in the US is the framework agreement between the Danish wind company
It will secure good paying jobs and training for hundreds of thousands of US workers
It is a great example of just transition in action
Europe led by agreements with employers and unions in Germany Spain and other nations are committed to a green deal with just transition
Underpinned by a social pillar of rights
Canada Scotland new Zealand South Africa Kenya Senegal Ghana and many others are among those with examples of agr agreements for social dialogue towards a just transition that will actually get the job done
This must be the case everywhere if we're to leave no one behind
But the good news is that for every dollar or euro or unit of currency invested in climate transition there are jobs
Ten jobs in renewable energy generates five to ten jobs in the supply chains
Up to three times that in economies where good wages are spent by those workers and their families
And if the pandemic has taught us anything it is that we also need resilience and care is vital to that healthcare age care child care and education
There are even more jobs where we build livable caring communities
We have the technology
We have the finance to get the job done
And if we share it with developing countries on top of vital debt relief if every dollar of investment has an esj lens we will win the race for a just recovery and a sustainable future
We need both ambition and the commitment on display here to adjust transition with social dialogue and all those as we head toward the cop in Glasgow this year
I leave you with this commitment from the union movement there are no jobs on the planet we will work with everybody to build good jobs on a living planet
Sharan that was incredible
Your passion is infectious
So next let me go to Brett Isaac the CEO and co-founder of Navajo power
Brett Navajo natural resources will continue to power the growth of the American west
This administration is committed to empowering tribal leaders and our collective efforts to tackle the climate crisis
So how is Navajo power envision climate solutions
At the epicenter of energy impact and want to continue being the driver of that effort through the cultivation of clean energy assets
As a developer of large scale utility projects Navajo power envisions creating the opportunity to Ttake the workforces and economies so crucial to advancing America's growth and re-engaging them in a new energy economy to advance clean energy growth needed to address climate impacts
We're excited to see President Biden's vision in engaging our communities and creating real tangible solutions to address the climate crisis -- equitable to those communities who will be on the edge of this work is a large step forward to acknowledging the foundation the movement must begin with collaboration
Travel nations believe that our role in this is to help accelerate you know the advancement of preservation of our culture our resources and of our mother earth
So the idea-hand the Navajo power wants to do is create the platform that is going to be the spark needed to accelerate the recovery and advancement of economies
There are a lot of workforces built on the previous energy economies that need this movement in order to advance and you know usher in a new era of energy usage and energy resiliency
And we believe that you know Navajo power itself can play a role in creating that landing spot for job growth for economic growth for communities to thrive under these conditions that we're looking to create with the development of large scale solar wind storage and all the other technologies that are yet to be developed that we need in order to get to a place where we feel like our environment is protected and preserved
So you know from you know what we see as an important step you know we thiank President Biden for convening this conversation because it is much overdue
It is much needed in order for us to advance going forward
I'm very proud that you know to be here to talk about what we're doing but also very proud to get to work under the administration's initiatives
Thank you
Thanks Brett
I know that tribal voices remain so important to us if we want to hope to lift all communities and all nations
So thank you very much for those words
Now I'm excited to hear from Nthabiseng Mosia the CEO of Easy Solar
Great name by the way
Easy Solar
The African continent currently faces a significant challenge 600 million people without access to a formal grid
It is also has a young and growing population
So what role can renewable energy play in accelerating both access to energy and economic livelihoods in Africa so we can ensure that no one is left behind
Thank you so much President Biden and the administration for convening this summit and for having me here
As a young African woman I'm incredibly grateful for the platform
It is a unique moment in our human story and I want to start by taking a moment to acknowledge where we find ourselves in history
Until recent times when any continent has attempted to bring people into the modern economy we have done so without concern for the planet and its limits
We're here today in sub-Saharan Africa where we're being asked not to copy and paste a formula that has proven effective time and time again in industrializing and modernizing human life
We have to give people dignified work that reduces inequality all the while not just looking at the economic but also being conscious of the climate at the same time
Now this may sound like an unfair conundrum and at times I lament at the injustice of having to worry about a problem we did not create
But I do believe it is a unique opportunity to look forward rather than backwards to challenge the status quo and say economic development does not have to be dirty
Progress does not have to be recklessly unjust
We as Africans can learn from the past and acknowledge what we have at our disposal in the present -- from 3000 in Sierra Leone my company operates in west Africa
Some African countries have the lowest rate of electrification in the world
When we started operating five years ago in Sierra Leone and Liberia it was as high as 95 of the population without power
And I mean being without power in so many more ways than one
Vast majority of people who are off grid based in rural communities with limited access to economic opportunities
If current trends continue 100 million youth will be entering the African labor market unemployed by 2030
This is important to me personally
I'm one of the fortunate young ones
Power went out a few nights a week in my home when I was growing up and I was lucky enough to have access to economic opportunity
We cannot let Africa's future rest on luck and good fortune and thankfully we don't have to
Here is where my optimism comes in
Easy Solar with many others are bringing power to people where they are
We're going all the way to the last mile and doing so by employing people who are from those communities
In short we're building power from the ground up
Companies across Africa and many grids are employing as many people as traditional utility power sectors in some of the more developed sectors in Africa
We heard from President Kenyata
The figure is comparable to the number employed by the Kenyan state utilities and here in west Africa in five short years created job opportunities for 800 young and passionate people who want to contribute positively to their communities
And beyond the direct employment we create access to electricity generates border economic activities
Some estimates put it as high as five times as many nonenergy productive use jobs are created through access to electricity
We are at a unique moment in history we have so much more at our disposal now and I think we can do it differently
We can power communities while providing access to good work without the negative impacts of carbon emissions that have characterized electrification in so many other parts of the world
I haven't spoken about it much but I want to close by saying I do believe there is a role for -- power but we cannot overlook that decentralizing renewable energy is a major part of the equation
We need firm commitments from government and the financial community $11 billion in funding a need to accelerate access to energy and economic opportunity at scale
We need to mainstream these solutions that will be a major part of wiping out energy poverty in Africa while providing young people with good work without harming the planet
I'm very excited abou ed d abou we're doing in our effort to leave nobody behind
Thank you very much
Nthabiseng thank you so much
I think young people everywhere in the US and across the world made a vast difference in pointing out the need for urgency around climate and bringing such fresh energy to the table and ideas
You're right we have to look to the future and it is yours
And we have to play our part
So thank you for that
Now let's turn to George Oliver the CEO of Johnson control
Good to see you
George is chairing the energy and environment committee at the business roundtable
And he's also leading Johnson controls one of the leading companies in the sustainable building space
George how do you see the outlook of business on strong climate action and what role can buildings play in tackling the climate crisis
Thank you miss McCarthy for leading this great discussion
Thank you Mr President distinguished leaders and members of the cabinet
It is truly an honor to be here today -- there are opportunities and communities large and small as we take action on climate and there is a need for training to fill good jobs being created
In my role as chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls a global leader in smart healthy and sustainable buildings we're eager to drive harder and faster to cut the 40 of greenhouse gases that come from buildings
The good news is that when we do that the upgrade pays for themselves because we're cutting energy waste
I also had the honor of chairing the business roundtable energy and environment committee in working with over 200 of America's LAlargest employers fm all sectors of the economy
The CEO recognized the threats posed by climate change
Business roundtable members believe the risks are real
They're increasing they are costly
They may be irreversible
As we look ahead to CoP 26 in November we have the chance to implement smart policies that ensure all communities and workers benefit from reducing carbon emissions
Business round table believes a comprehensive market-based policy can ensure equity and help avoid the worst impacts of climate change
Importantly business roundtable knows that business and government must work together and lead by example to meet the scope of the challenge
In fact the vast majority of business roundtable CEOs have pledged to reduce their emissions with nearly half committing to achieving net zero emissions in their companies by 2050 or sooner
Johnson Controls sustain abiliy is our business
We announced science-based targets -- 100 most sustainable companies globally
President Biden called for a 4 million -- billion to be revamped
Absolutely
And Johnson Controls we know that can be done and we would be foolish not to do so because inefficient buildings our climate has them
Because money is wasted right along with energy
Working with our customers we cut emissions more than 30 million tons and we have saved them $6 billion
We guarantee the results since we are confident substantial savings will be achieved
With digital technologies like our open blue platform we are creating not only efficient but net zero buildings campuses and whole communities
So we think it is clear driving sustainability and tackling climate change is a collective effort
The business roundtable and Johnson controls we know when we take this challenge on we will cut emissions and cost and create good jobs and build resilient healthy infrastructure
Mr President we are ready to get to work
Thank you
Well George thank you
It is incredible to have the business roundtable and your voice so powerfully on this issue with us
It means a lot as well as your leadership at Johnson Controls
It is quite inspirational
Next let's hear from Roxanne brown
Hi Rocki Roxie good it sto se
What can governments around the world do to ensure that we put workers right square at the center of our transition to clean infrastructure
Thank you so much for the question Gina
So great to see you and see you as well President Biden
It is an honor to join this summit on behalf of the 850000 members of the United Steel Workers union in the US and Canada and we really commend the Biden/Harris administration for actively seeking out the voice of labor in this really important discussion
And I would say that is the first part of my answer
Governments around the world can ensure that workers are at the center of a clean energy infrastructure by simply making room for us at the table
Like you did today
Oftentimes policymakers form ideas about what they think is essential for workers in a particular state industry region province or country but really only workers can best answer the question of how a net zero economy includes us
And I urge leaders around the world to engage in earnest and honest conversations with workers and unions as policies are being formed and to understand that workers are key allies and shaping and moving policy and should not be an after thought
In your question Gina you mentioned the various sectors members are employed in from the steel plate our members at Cleveland cliffs in Gary Indiana makes to the fiber-optic cables our members at corning in Wilmington North Carolina make to the Proterra electric buses our members in Los Angeles California make to the water system distribution services our members at American water and Kokomo Indiana provide to the copper our members at Rio tinto mine
Members supply America every day with a component energy critical materials and services for our nation's physical and social infrastructure
And we recently kicked off a campaign called we supply America to highlight the important role our members play
They're proud to do this work
Their families depend on the good family sustaining union wages and benefits attached to these jobs and communities all across this country depend on the tax base those jobs provide to help fund our schools and libraries
We must strengthen our domestic manufacturing base and support its critical workforce here at home to manufacture the next generation of these technologies
In addition to expanding and sourcing from the domestic supply chain right here with the right policies we can incentivize industry to decarbonize and maximize energy efficiency by investing in technologies like carbon capture direct air capture renewable biomass and combined heat and power
These are all ways to ensure that workers will be at the center of US clean energy infrastructure
And you know I have to say we strongly agree President Biden that the American jobs plan is a once in a generation transformational type of investment
We are ready to help pass policies like the protecting the right to organize act that will help make the new jobs of the clean energy economy family and community sustaining union jobs
We are ready to support you and helping advance and revitalize existing industries putting workers at the center of those solutions and building an even stronger manufacturing and energy-base for generations to come
Our sleeves are rolled up
Our boots are on the ground and we are ready to go
Thank you so much
Thank you
She never fails to supply the right words at the right time and thank you so much
Union
Not labor union
There you go
I want to just say that these unions have not just a place at the table but we're listening
And President Biden is making sure of that
So thank you so much
Let's turn now to Erica Mackie the CEO of Grid Alternatives
Erica I had the privilege of attending two Grid Alternatives solar installations
You had me on the roof on both of those occasions
And I talked to the job trainees learning solar skills while they were installing solar and low income communities and communities of color in Los Angeles and in Washington DC
So how does Grid Alternatives work
Illustrate how clean energy can be beneficial to all individuals in families in every community
Thank you national climate adviser McCarthy
You were awesome on the rooftop
President Biden secretary Kerry dignitaries thank you for having me
Grid Alternatives mission is to build community powered solutions to advance economic and environmental justice through renewable energy
The past 20 years Grid Alternatives the nation's largest nonprofit solar installer has been working with communities most impacted by economic and climate injustices clean energy and jobs to all families and individuals
We will not achieve a renewable energy future without addressing the systemic injustices that have disproportionately impacted people of color
The benefits of renewable energy clean air long lasting careers lower energy bills must not be limited to the privileged
Yet low income communities and communities of color are usually left out of the conversations about our clean energy future
And I applaud the administration for the environmental justice council
Grid Alternatives works coast to coast to push for policies that make solar energy and cutting edge clean technologies available to everyone
By creating strong policy solutions that center the leadership of economic and environmental justice communities we can ensure everyone benefits now and for generations to come
Clean energy can be transformative for the people the planet and the economy
A growing solar energy industry needs skilled workers of all levels
Solar jobs are meaningful and pay well
With Grid Alternatives hands on training individuals learn solar skills while participating in real world solar installations
We make training opportunities accessible to groups that are intratraditionally underreprese in solar
Our graduates jumpstart life long careers and connecting with employers or starting their own successful business ventures
Clean energy together with energy storage electrification and other technologies is necessary for both climate mitigation and climate adaptation
While replacing polluting energy sources clean energy investments also benefit health
Clean energy makes us more resilient to the increasingly common disasters brought on by the climate crisis
Families depend on electricity for medical equipment and food when the power goes out local solar and storage can save lives
Families harmed most by fossil fuel pollution and climate destruction also pay more of their incomes for the very energy systems causing those harms
Another source of economic instability
Those most impacted by fossil fuel pollution climate induced disaster and energy costs must be first from climate solutions
They must benefit first not as an after thought
Energy agency and ownership must and can be put in the hands of communities through clean energy transition
We need to include everyone in climate solutions
We need climate justice
Grid Alternatives and visions rapid equitable transition to a world powered by renewable energy that benefits everyone
Our experience on the ground shows this critical opportunity is possible with collective effort
Great job
Erica thank you very much
I know Grid Alternatives always reminds us that clean energy is not a luxury for a few it is a necessity for all of us
Thank you for advancing that
Now let's hear from Jack Allen the CEO of Proterra who I'm sure the President remembers was gracious enough to virtually host him just a few days ago
Jack Proterra manufactures half of the US electric bus market
Which is pretty amazing
And as you know funding for electric school buses is a priority in the American jobs plan
Electrifying our bus fleet is good for the planet good for community health and good for jobs
So- what role do you see the federal government playing in spurring the demand for zero emission electric vehicles including school buses
Before you talk I want to thank you for spending some time with me
I told you I used to drive a school bus I want to drive one of your electric school buses okay
I got a license
Okay
That would be -- that would be just great Mr President
And thank you national climate adviser McCarthy and Mr President from all of us at Proterra for having the opportunity to be with you twice in one week
It is quite incredible
Thank you all very much
Proterra is grateful for the government's support of electric transit buses and zero emission transportation
We delivered our first electric transit bus over a decade ago at foothill transit with the support of funding from the 2009 recovery act
Building on these early deployments the federal government increased support for zero emission electric transportation through programs like the federal transit administration low and no emission vehicle program
It provides funding to state and local governments to acquire zero emission transit buses and has been responsible for funding hundreds of electric transit buses across the nation from Juneau Alaska
It wasn't that long ago that the questions many were asking is whether the transit market would even move towards electrification
That question has been answered
Thanks to the help of the federal government this transition is well under way
Proterra's initial development over a decade ago we sold more than a thousand electric transit buses
Where do we go now
There is an opportunity for the federal government to go even further by spurring increase demand for commercial electric vehicles or infrastructure and to deepen the supply base in the United States
School buses as you mentioned they're a great example of one of the most exciting applications for electric vehicle technology
Switching to electric school buses means cleaner air for our children and our grandchildren to breathe and a healthier planet for them to enjoy
Yet today unlike transit buses school buses do not receive the same level of federal funding for electrification
So federal programs can help SV as a road map to do other commercial vehicles to electrification such as delivery vehicles
One of the lessons we learned over a decade is a critical role that charging and infrastructure plays in electrification
Our customers have told us they would like to go faster towards electrification
Charging remains a barrier to ev adoption
Private enterprise had to solve this challenge and we will
It is well worthy of strong support from the federal government to prepare the nation for our clean transportation future
This includes convening public partner -- public/private partnerships on charging infrastructure between the government companies like Proterra fine union organizations that are represented at this summit and electric utilities nationwide collectively we can do this
Electric vehicle technology is an opportunity for the United States to be at the leading edge of the innovations that create good American jobs
Will modernize our nation's infrastructure and help to build a more just and resilient economy
With over 600 employees nationwide including as Roxanne said many represented by the United Steel Workers we experienced firsthand at Proterra we believe the technologies that we need to meet global demand for zero emission transportation can and must be built right here in the United States including cell manufacturing
Thank you for the opportunity to be with you today
What a wonderful thrill for all of us at Proterra
Thank you
Thank you
George thank you
Thank you for -- for all of your commitment to our kids and to our cities and making the air CLE cle cleaner
As a grandmother of three young kids I very much appreciate it
Thank you for that
I thank the President of the United States for the American jobs plan is going to go all in on building the charging infrastructure that we need that is going to allow George to expand his business and all of us to --  The guy is going to build the air front
Let's move on
I'll tell you that we want to talk to Lonnie Stevenson right now Lonnie is the President of the international brotherhood of electric workers
And he is -- he is last but certainly not least because he's a major player in looking at how we can actually build his union with almost 800000 skilled members across the wide variety of fields
They will build our country moving forward as well
Lonnie what do energy workers need to see in order to feel really confident that they will not be left behind in a transition to cleaner power generation
Thank you adviser McCarthy and thank you Mr President
Thank you for your invitation and thank you for hosting this event today
This is such a critical question
You made clear again and again fighting climate change isn't just about cutting carbon emissions but creating good jobs
And creating good jobs means above all creating union jobs
As the President of the largest energy union in all of north America my members work in every sector that is out there
From coal and gas to wind and solar and nuclear and power transmission and delivery
These are good union jobs
Jobs that are the foundation of a strong middle class and healthy communities
It is folks like my members that are leading the clean power revolution keeping them at the center of the clean energy industry requires lawmakers and leaders to take some key steps
First we must tie all federal clean energy investments from direct infrastructure spending to tax credits to strong labor protections
Protections like prevailing wage loss which promote higher incomes safer work sites and increased productivity
Protections like buy American provisions that make sure the push for zero carbon energy results in more domestic and manufacturing jobs
Such as those that would be created by the production of fuels that are needed for the next generation of nuclear reactors
Mr President I know that you have laid out an ambiguous plan to build a massive network of electric vehicle charging stations with journey level electricians who are certified by the electric vehicle infrastructure training program
That means hundreds of thousands of good new union construction and manufacturing jobs
And protections like stronger collective bargaining rights that give all energy workers the right to freely join the union
Many existing energy jobs are good jobs for one reason
And that's because they are union jobs
But the truth is not enough solar wind and other renewable power are -- power are union jobs
That's why passing the pro act is so important this legislation -- their right to join a union of their choice and harder for the employers to interfere with that right
I know that you support that Mr President and I hope the US Senate will move on it soon
We also need local highing environments tied to all projects that receive federal investment
They open the doors to good paying union careers and secure the jobs go to those who need them the most
Bringing a measure of environmental justice to communities that have paid too high a price through pollution and discrimination and now suffer from years of disinvestment
Finally as important as solar and wind are we must invest in all forms of carbon free energy technologies
Such as carbon capture hydrogen and nuclear this isn't just good for the environment
This is good for the economy
And for jobs as well
For example IBEW members operate or maintain over 90 of the US nuclear fleet and nuclear power plant operators are among the highest hourly wages in the United States
That's the power of a union contract
We also need the support building out our modern grid
That means doubling the transmission capacity
That means smarter neighborhood distribution systems all interconnected by 21st century network of fiber-optics and that can double as the company's consumer broadband network
That's not only the backbone of a clean economy it is a sure fire way to create more skilled union jobs
The current energy transition be with a win for the climate and a win for jobs as long as lawmakers commit to implementing labor protections that ensure new energy jobs are good for -- this is once in a lifetime opportunity to build our economy back better
And the men and the women of the IBEW are ready to get working
Our nation can move into the clean energy future
Thank you again for the opportunity
Thank you Lonnie
Thank you so much Lonnie
And I know that between you and your 800000 skilled members we are going to make it in America
So I'm very excited
And Mr President I'm sure you'll agree this was an incredible panel
And I want to thank everybody for your passion your inspiration and your willingness to tell us that the -- that the future is ours if we want to grab it
And we are going to do just that
So let me turn it over now to ambassador Tai and again thank you for everyone for your terrific words
Thank you so much
I would like to thank President Baden prime minister Sanchez President Buhari President Phuc President Duda my colleagues here secretary Buttigieg adviser McCarthy and all of our panelists today for the thoughtful and inspiring program that we have just been a part of
This week's summit underscores the reality that our time to tackle the climate crisis is now
And today's speakers have shown that taking meaningful steps to combat climate change can be a powerful driver of economic opportunity good paying jobs and positive global competition
As the United States trade representative my work lies at the intersection of domestic and international economic policy
I know that care and maintenance of our planet's environmental conditions are critical to our economic viability and our potential for shared prosperity
As we say necessity is the mother of invention
The need to act on climate requires significant change and it is already sparking innovation and opportunity
We can build on these beginnings towards a future that is cleaner and brighter with new market opportunities and high paying quality jobs
And we must do so in a way that advances equity for underserved and marginalized communities
As countries around the world determine their domestic measures for decarbonization environmental conservation and clean energy trade policy can be a powerful tool to create the incentives for positive competition and a race to the top in realizing our collective prosperity
Historic approaches and new initiatives like those discussed today and the proposals included in the American jobs plan the empowering people clean energy initiative and plans for zero emissions transportation and transshipment all of these clearly demonstration that innovative and dynamic solutions are within our reach
Most importantly today's discussion offers us hope ideas and an invitation to join forces to do our part realize the goal of transitioning to net zero by 2050 in order to preserve and protect our planet and create economic opportunities for our children and their children
Now it is my pleasure to turn to special envoy Kerry for some final thoughts
Before you go John one thing to this panel if I may
You know every once in a while you are confronted as a government official a business leader labor leader with a real problem
And it doesn't take you long to figure out that -- how to turn it into an opportunity
One thing John everybody talked about today was -- is there anything else you can think of that could create as many good jobs going into the middle of the 21st century
Think about it
What else could there be that would have the opportunity to create so many jobs while doing so much good
Every single one of you business leaders labor leaders foreign leaders foreign -- foreign -- leaders of other parts of the world every one of you you talked about this in terms of -- it is astounding
And I think this is part of that fourth industrial revolution here
This is an opportunity to -- and the process this time of doing the right thing and creating jobs of actually bringing our countries closer together
Because it is in our interest just like -- excuse the colloquial reference but my mother would always say when something very bad would happen in our family out of everything bad Joe something good will come if you look out for it
We're seeing that with the God awful crisis where we lost millions of people to COVID-19
You see the collaboration we never had before that I have
I've been doing this a long long time
And it makes us realize that you can't build a wall high enough to be able to keep out whatever that next virus is
You have to take care of the virus where it originates
No matter how small the country no matter how wealthy no matter how poor it is
I know that's why for example we're working like the devil to get to a point we can export a vaccine
But think of this as well
Every one of you the last two days have talked about the need for us to collaborate
I'm fascinated that -- and I happen to agree with them that you know President Putin and I have our disagreements but he's talking about how you capture carbon from space
You and I have talked about that
The whole notion that it makes overwhelming sense as much as the President of Russia and I disagree that two big nations can cooperate
To get something done
And this time get something done that benefits everybody
It is not like we're arguing whether or not one nation is going to be better benefited or worse impacted by what we do
And so I just think that if we can keep the focus on the jobs we're going to create the economic opportunity the growth and for -- and my country at least on union jobs to provide the ability to raise the economy raise the gdp raise every part of who we are I think this is just an incredible opportunity
Incredible opportunity
I've been working with the business roundtable which is you know the idea of the business roundtable afl-cio working together when I came into politics years ago was nonexistent almost
But we see the opportunities
I hope we don't lose focus here
Lose the sense of how much we can do together by helping ourselves
We're helping ourselves we're helping others in this endeavor
It is really important
And I just want to say one thing to the Navajo nation let my wife come home she likes the Navajo nation too much
She keeps being out there
She's out there for two days out there before I don't know
You know what I mean
I called her I said where are you she said I'm staying another day
Let her come home okay
I don't want her you know that's too far for me to commute
I shouldn't be so -- but look this is -- this is about what we can do together
And I would be remiss if I didn't say I don't consider -- you're giving me a lot of credit for convening this
I wouldn't have convened this had I not had the overwhelming help support and initiative from former secretary Kerry my good friend
This is -- he feels this is his bones this is to him something that is consequential and he knows a lot about it so you're not -- you are going to continue to see a lot of all of us here
Anyway I want to thank you John before you -- before this panel got shut out because I -- by the way first person I went I got in trouble was Biden really going to do something about the environment
First person I went to Lonnie Stevenson IBEW
People talk about how we don't get this done and don't care about jobs
And Lonnie established up and labor stepped up and businesses stepping up
So I want to thank you
Sorry for being so colleoquial but thank you
Thank you for your personal comments
More importantly thank you for your leadership because we wouldn't be here without you having had the courage and the readiness to take this on and tackle tough issues
If I may just want to thank ambassador Tai and thank secretary Buttigieg and my cohort my colleague from Massachusetts Gina McCarthy
Mr President it is your vision that set out to convene this summit
Not 100 days into your presidency
And I want to thank you for demonstrating your deep commitment to action for bringing together so many essential voices that have been articulated as any I have ever heard who want to do the same
And they all understand as you have said Mr President this decade these next ten years are the critical years
And the scientists have told us une that we have ten years to make the decisions and implement them to avoid the worst consequences
That's why we're here
This has to be the decade of decision
This is the period of time
Why
Because only if we reduce sufficiently in this decade can we keep alive the vision of 15 degrees and can we achieve 2015 net zero
So Mr President as we approach the end of this summit this leaders summit on climate let me again thank all of the leaders and participants who have joined us over the past few days as well as those who are tuning in at home and all over the world
We're deeply appreciative
We're very very grateful for your partnership all of you all of the countries represented here we are going to continue these conversations of course in the next months
We have six months plus to Glasgow and as President Biden has said and I can affirm again and again and many of you have said to me Glasgow is the last best hope we have to ga gavelize the world to move in this direction and get the job done
And what President Biden and all the rest of us hope this summit has done is shown particularly in these last two panels this is a plus this is an economic bonanza
This is an opportunity to have the greatest beneficial economic transformation since the industrial revolution
And we learned a lot since then
So we will continue on the road at the direction of President Biden
Mr President
John thank you
As we close this historic summit I want to take a moment to thank the world leaders and all the participants from around the globe who have joined together to confront the existential threat of climate change there is no threat like it
Over the last two days I think we ade important progress and the spirit of increasing efforts to address climate change globally to help developing countries strengthen their climate efforts while achieving their development goals
And that's going to mean money
Yesterday I announced the United States made a new commitment under the Paris agreement to cut our emissions by 50 to 52 by the end of this decade
And we'll get there by investing in American workers and American jobs and American infrastructure and building a stronger and more resilient economy
We also welcome am BIambitious targets announced by two great partners the prime minister of Japan prime minister suga announced that Japan will cut emissions by up to 50 below the 2013 levels
Almost doubling their current target
Prime minister Trudeau will reduce emissions by as much as 45 below the 2005 levels
These amounts came on top of demonstrated leadership and strong existing targets set by the European union and the united kingdom
Together these commitments mean that half of the world's economy is now committed to outpace the action that we need at a pace we need to limit warming to 15 degrees
An amount beyond which scientists tell us a thousand times all of us could be at a point of no return
We also heard encouraging news announcements from Argentina Brazil South Africa south Korea
I'm looking forward to working with India's prime minister Modi in a new partnership to achieve our climate and energy goals making this a core pillar of our bilateral cooperation
And the commitments we have made must become real
Commitment without us doing that is just a lot of hot air
No pun intended
And we must implement these commitments
Accelerate them and innovate and invest in order to reach them
And we need to work together once again to build a clean energy future that delivers good jobs and overcomes the threat of climate change
Investing in innovation and in our people raising our ambitions ensuring every nation does its part and will meet again in Glasgow in November for the UN climate conversation
I believe we're going to meet those moments
And I think we're going to meet the moment that we all have been talking about to make this commitment
And to keep the commitment
I think it is a moral imperative to future generations
Here in America there has never been a challenge we couldn't meet if we put our minds to it and did it together
I hope your countries feel the same way
I know we can do this
I know we can do this
Thank you for your commitment thank you for joining the summit and thank you for stepping up to confront this crisis before it is too late
I know we can seize the opportunities of a cleaner stronger and more resilient economy
And deliver the benefits to people in each of our nations
So I look forward to working alongside you to confront the climate crisis to build a better world for all of our children and grandchildren
We're going to do this together
Thank you all and may God bless you and let's get to work
Thanks again
Thanks everybody
We know the kind of world we want healthier safer more sustainable equitable where nature thrives communities are healthy and opportunities are plentiful
We know we can create this world the challenge is profound
And we must move faster than ever before
But the world is ready for action
We can limit climate change with a Singsingularity of purpo
Every nation united in commitment ready to measure success with progress not promises and ensure that when the story of our time is written we will have met this moment
We can do this
We must do this and we will do this
The time for action is now
